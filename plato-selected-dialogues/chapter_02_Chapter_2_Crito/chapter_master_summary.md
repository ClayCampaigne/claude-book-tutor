<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Plato’s Crito reframes Socrates not as a man on a divine mission but as an exemplary citizen whose steadfastness lies in never doing wrong or returning wrong, guided by reason and the judgment of the one wise person rather than the many. At dawn, with the Delian ship sighted off Sunium, Crito urges a nighttime escape. Socrates, calm and buoyed by a dream foretelling a day’s reprieve, insists the only question is whether escape would be just.

Crito’s case is practical and urgent: friends (Crito, Simmias, Cebes) can fund and manage the flight; informers are no real threat; Thessaly offers safety; escape would spare friends disgrace, frustrate enemies, and allow Socrates to raise his children. Socrates replies that zeal must follow right reason: as one heeds a trainer for the body, one must heed the knowledgeable about justice for the soul, which is more valuable than the body. Core axioms govern: value not mere life but a good (just, honorable) life; never do wrong, nor repay wrong, nor ward off evil by doing evil—even under threat of death. Money, reputation, and child-rearing are “opinions of the many,” irrelevant unless escape is just; the wicked cannot touch one’s virtue.

The argument culminates in the personified Laws. They “reared” Socrates and stand higher than parents; one must either persuade the city of what is just or obey it, bearing penalties without “retreat” from one’s legal “rank.” Athens allows departure at maturity; by choosing lifelong residence, raising children there, and declining exile at trial, Socrates tacitly consented. To flee would be “thrice wrong”: against parents (the Laws), educators, and his own agreement. It would endanger friends, mark him an enemy to law in well-governed cities, and reduce him to shame in lawless Thessaly. The children argument fails: exile harms their citizenship, and friends can rear them if he dies. Justice must come before life; escaping would wrong the Laws, the city, friends, and himself, and incur reproach “below.” Socrates resolves to obey. Plato thus defends his citizenship against later charges tied to followers and neutrality, while the historicity of any real escape plan remains uncertain.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Framing and aim: Crito presents Socrates not as divine-mission philosopher but as model citizen who obeys the laws even under an unjust sentence. Plato’s purpose is to show steadfast adherence to the principle “never do wrong or return wrong,” guided by reason and the judgment of the one wise person, not the many. The dialogue is a tight dialectic culminating in a personified “Laws” speech: by lifelong residence Socrates tacitly consented to Athens’ laws; breaking them now would dishonor him, harm friends, and affront both the city’s Laws and those “below.” Plato defends Socrates’ citizenship against charges tied to his followers and political neutrality; historicity of the escape proposal is uncertain. The “wicked can neither do good nor harm” means they cannot touch one’s virtue.

- Dramatic setup: With the Delian ship sighted off Sunium, Crito visits at dawn; Socrates, calm, predicts a one-day delay based on a dream (“third day to Phthia”).

- Crito’s case for escape: practical ease and funding (Crito, Simmias, Cebes), manageable risk of informers, welcome and safety in Thessaly, avoidance of friends’ disgrace, thwarting enemies, and duty to raise his children.

- Socrates’ stance: discount the many’s opinion—they cannot make one wise or foolish—and focus solely on whether escape is just.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Crito intensifies his plea: Socrates owes it to his children to live and educate them; refusing escape is cowardly and will disgrace his friends. Action must be taken this very night.
- Socrates insists zeal must be aligned with right reason. He reaffirms the prior principle: heed only the judgment of the one who knows (the wise), not the many. Using the trainer/physician analogy, he argues that following the ignorant harms the body; likewise, following the many about justice harms the soul, which is more valuable than the body.
- Core axioms restated: not life but a good (just, honorable) life is to be valued; one must never do wrong, nor repay wrong with wrong, nor ward off evil by doing evil—even under threat of death. Thus money, reputation, and child-rearing concerns are “opinions of the many” and irrelevant unless escape is just.
- Transition to the “Laws” argument: escaping would wrong those least to be wronged—the Laws. Personified Laws would say escape overthrows legal authority. They “reared” Socrates through marriage, education, and civic order; the city is holier than parents. One must either persuade the city to change what is just or obey; not retaliate against it. Crito agrees the Laws speak truly.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Personified Laws assert the city is holier than parents; one must either persuade it of what is just or obey it. Punishments (imprisonment, death in war) must be borne; no “retreat” from one’s legal “rank.”
- Athens grants freedom to leave with one’s property upon maturity; continued residence constitutes an implied contract to obey. Disobedience is “thrice wrong”: against one’s parents (the Laws), one’s educators, and one’s explicit agreement.
- Socrates is uniquely bound: he chose lifelong residence, showed no interest in other polities, raised his children in Athens, and at sentencing refused to propose exile. To flee now would violate his long-standing assent.
- Practical and moral fallout of escape: friends risk exile, loss of property, or civic penalties; well-governed cities would see Socrates as an enemy to law and thus confirm the judges’ verdict; in lawless Thessaly he would live shamefully as a flatterer, contradicting his teaching on justice.
- Children argument rebutted: flight either deprives them of Athenian citizenship or leaves them to friends’ care—care they can equally provide if Socrates dies.
- Justice must come before life; escaping would return wrong for wrong and wrong the Laws, the city, friends, and himself, incurring reproach “below.” Socrates resolves to obey this “voice” and accept his fate.
