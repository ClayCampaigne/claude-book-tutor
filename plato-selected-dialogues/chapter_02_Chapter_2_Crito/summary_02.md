- Crito intensifies his plea: Socrates owes it to his children to live and educate them; refusing escape is cowardly and will disgrace his friends. Action must be taken this very night.
- Socrates insists zeal must be aligned with right reason. He reaffirms the prior principle: heed only the judgment of the one who knows (the wise), not the many. Using the trainer/physician analogy, he argues that following the ignorant harms the body; likewise, following the many about justice harms the soul, which is more valuable than the body.
- Core axioms restated: not life but a good (just, honorable) life is to be valued; one must never do wrong, nor repay wrong with wrong, nor ward off evil by doing evil—even under threat of death. Thus money, reputation, and child-rearing concerns are “opinions of the many” and irrelevant unless escape is just.
- Transition to the “Laws” argument: escaping would wrong those least to be wronged—the Laws. Personified Laws would say escape overthrows legal authority. They “reared” Socrates through marriage, education, and civic order; the city is holier than parents. One must either persuade the city to change what is just or obey; not retaliate against it. Crito agrees the Laws speak truly.
