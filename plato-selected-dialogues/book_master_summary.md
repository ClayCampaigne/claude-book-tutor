# Book Overview
Plato’s selected dialogues stage Socrates’ final acts—defense, refusal to escape, last arguments, and critiques of love and rhetoric—to model the examined life and the primacy of justice. Across shifting settings, he opposes flattery with philosophy, grounds virtue in care of the soul, and reframes power as achieving what is truly good before gods and city.

# Chapter Summaries
1. Apology: At trial, Socrates rejects ornamented rhetoric, separates old slanders from formal charges, recounts the Delphic mission that made him test pretended wisdom, cross-examines Meletus to expose contradictions on corruption and impiety, affirms obedience to god and daimonion over safety, refuses supplication or conditional acquittal, proposes a fine, accepts death serenely, and proclaims the examined life and moral integrity invulnerable.

2. Crito: In prison at dawn, Crito urges escape; Socrates, heeding the one wise rather than the many, argues one must never do wrong nor repay wrong, elevates the soul’s health above life, personifies the Athenian Laws as parents and educators to whom he consented by residence, deems flight a triple injustice harming friends and city, and resolves to obey judgment.

3. Phaedo: On his last day Socrates calls philosophy a practice of dying, defining death as soul’s release for grasping immutable Forms, argues immortality via opposites, recollection, and affinity, answers Simmias’ harmony and Cebes’ wear-and-tear with a causal turn to Forms and an exclusion principle making the soul imperishable, prescribes virtue’s purification, narrates likely eschatology, and drinks the hemlock calmly.

4. Phaedrus: Walking beyond the walls, Socrates critiques Lysias’ written praise of the non-lover, then recants to honor divine madness—prophecy, rites, poetry, supremely eros—through the charioteer myth in which Beauty sparks recollection and temperate love’s ascent; he refounds rhetoric as dialectical knowledge of souls using collection and division, warns that writing is a mute image, and prays for inner harmony.

5. Gorgias: Testing Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles, Socrates demotes rhetoric to flattering cookery opposed to the true arts that heal body and soul, argues paradoxically that doing injustice harms one’s soul more than suffering it and that punishment is curative, disentangles pleasure from the good to redefine power as achieving real benefit, condemns flattering politics, and closes with judgment-myth and austere civic ideal.

# Key Themes
- Examined life: Moral integrity valued above safety, wealth, or reputation.
- Justice and law: Never do wrong; civic obedience grounded in rational consent; punishment as soul-cure.
- Soul and immortality: Philosophy purifies; recollection of Forms; hope of postmortem judgment.
- Eros and education: Divine madness, Beauty, and recollection elevate character toward virtue.
- Rhetoric vs dialectic: True speech requires knowledge of truth and souls; writing is secondary to living inquiry.
- Knowledge vs opinion: Follow the one wise, not the many; distinguish seeming from real benefit.
- Power redefined: Genuine power is capacity to realize the good, not mere gratification or dominance.
- Piety without dogma: Daimonion-guided mission and ethical obedience to the divine.
