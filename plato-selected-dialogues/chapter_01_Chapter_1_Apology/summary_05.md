- Refuting atheism: Socrates exposes Meletus’ contradiction. If Meletus’ indictment says Socrates teaches/believes in “spiritual/divine agencies” (daimonia), then he must believe in gods or their offspring (demigods); believing in divine things without divinities is as absurd as believing in horsemanship without horses. Thus the atheism charge is frivolous.

- Real threat: not Meletus/Anytus but long-standing envy/slander will kill him.

- Ethical stance on danger: A good man weighs right vs. wrong, not life vs. death. He cites Achilles and his own military obedience (Potidaea, Amphipolis, Delium). Fear of death is a pretence of knowledge; he claims only to know that injustice and disobedience to rightful authority (human or divine) are evil.

- Defiance of conditional acquittal: Even if released on condition he stop philosophizing, he would refuse; he will obey the god and continue examining all—prioritizing care of the soul over wealth/reputation. Virtue yields money and other goods, not vice versa.

- Gadfly metaphor: He is a divine gift to Athens, a gadfly rousing a great sluggish horse; killing him harms the city more than him. Bad men cannot truly harm a better man; the greater evil is committing injustice.

- No profit motive: His poverty evidences he never took pay.

- Why he avoids politics: His daimonion (a forbidding inner sign) deters it; an honest public opponent of mass injustice would die quickly. Proof: as prytanis at the Arginusae generals’ trial, he alone opposed the illegal collective trial, braving threats and popular clamor to uphold law.
