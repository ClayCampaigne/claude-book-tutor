- Plato’s Apology is presented as an idealized reconstruction of Socrates’ defense rather than a verbatim report; it matches Xenophon in tone (defiant, unconciliatory) but prioritizes Plato’s portrayal of Socrates’ character over literal accuracy. Plato likely uses some genuine details (e.g., Plato as surety; Plato present at the trial) but the Delphic-oracle origin story may be literary.  
- The Apology has three parts: defense, penalty mitigation, and final prophetic words. This chunk summarizes the first part.  
- Socrates rejects rhetorical ornament, claiming only truth as “rhetoric.” He distinguishes two accusers: long-standing public prejudice (fueled by comedy like Aristophanes) and the formal accusers (Meletus, et al.).  
- He refutes identification with natural philosophers and Sophists, denies taking fees, and explains his mission: after the Delphic oracle called him wisest, he tested politicians, poets, and craftsmen, finding their ignorance masked by conceit; his exposing of pretended wisdom bred hostility and charges of corruption/impiety.  
- Cross-examining Meletus, Socrates shows contradictions about corruption and disbelief in gods (confusion with Anaxagoras).  
- He asserts duty to obey the god even unto death, cites military courage and resistance to injustice (trial of the generals; defiance of the Thirty), avoids politics due to a divine sign, teaches without fee, and refuses to beg for mercy; supporters, including Plato, attest his integrity.
