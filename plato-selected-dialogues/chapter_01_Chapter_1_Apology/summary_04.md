- Pursuing the Delphic mission, Socrates tests reputed wisdom across groups and finds the highly esteemed often most foolish; the lesser-regarded are wiser.  
  - Poets: cannot explain their own verses; create by inspiration, not knowledge, and presume wisdom in other fields.  
  - Artisans: truly know their crafts but overgeneralize to “high matters,” letting conceit overshadow real expertise. Socrates prefers his awareness of ignorance over their mix of knowledge and unwarranted confidence.

- He interprets the oracle as: only God is wise; the “wisest” human knows his wisdom is worth nothing. Obedience to this divine task consumes his life, leaving him poor.

- Wealthy youths follow and imitate his examinations; those exposed grow angry and spread stock slanders (natural philosophy, atheism, making worse cause better). This fuels organized hostility: Meletus (poets), Anytus (craftsmen/politicians), Lycon (rhetoricians).

- Addressing the formal charges:  
  - Corruption: Meletus claims everyone improves youth except Socrates. Socrates counters with the horse-trainer analogy (the many harm; a few specialists improve) and argues no one would intentionally corrupt those around him; if unintentional, it warrants private correction, not prosecution.  
  - Impiety/atheism: Meletus calls him a “complete atheist” yet also accuses him of introducing new divinities and confuses him with Anaxagoras’ natural doctrines. Socrates highlights this contradiction and moves to argue that belief in divine things implies belief in divinities (argument to follow).
