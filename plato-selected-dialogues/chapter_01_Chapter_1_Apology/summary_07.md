- In the penalty phase, Socrates rejects imprisonment (would be a “slave” of the Eleven), a fine he cannot pay (which would mean jail until payment), and exile (he’d be driven out everywhere, since youths would gather to him and elders would expel him). Asked to be silent in a foreign city, he refuses: obeying the god requires continual examination; “the unexamined life is not worth living.”  
- Lacking money, he first offers one mina, then—at the urging of friends who will stand surety—proposes a fine of thirty minae (Plato, Crito, Critobulus, Apollodorus).  
- To those who condemned him: killing him gains Athens only a bad name and little time, since he is old. He was not convicted for lack of words but because he refused unworthy supplication. The task is not to avoid death but unrighteousness; he accepts his sentence and declares his accusers condemned by truth. He prophesies that, after his death, more and harsher critics will arise; killing critics won’t stop censure—self-improvement will.  
- To those who would have acquitted him: his daimonion’s silence shows death is good. Death is either dreamless sleep (a gain) or a migration where he can question true judges and heroes; there, inquiry does not incur death. Nothing evil befalls a good man; the gods care for him. He bears no anger, and asks that his sons be reproved if they value wealth over virtue or pretend to wisdom. He ends: he goes to die, they to live—only God knows which is better.
