- Socrates challenges claims of “corruption” by pointing to the uncorrupted fathers and brothers of his associates (including Plato) who support him. He refuses to supplicate or parade family, arguing such pleas dishonor Athens and would ask judges to break their oath.  
- He is convicted. In the penalty phase he first claims he merits public maintenance in the Prytaneum; uncertain whether death is bad, but sure imprisonment/exile are; offers a fine (first 1 mina, then 30 minae with friends as surety). He is condemned to death.  
- He refuses regret, preferring to die on principle; says injustice’s penalty is swifter than death and has already overtaken his accusers. He prophesies his death will spawn more, harsher critics of the Athenians.  
- To his would-be acquitters: his daimonion never checked his defense—sign to him that death is good—either dreamless sleep or migration to a just afterworld; nothing evil befalls a good man. He forgives judges and asks they admonish his sons if they value wealth over virtue.  
- Editorial analysis: Plato’s Socrates uses ad hominem, ironic refutations of Meletus (e.g., belief in daimons implies not atheism), offers a formally weak but substantively defensible separation from the crimes of Alcibiades/Critias, and advances the doctrine that all wrongdoing is involuntary (practically untenable). He neither affirms nor denies state gods, yet is pious in practice and guided by a divine sign. His tone shifts from gentle to lofty; contrasts with Sophists (poor, public, unpaid, non-professorial). Historicity is uncertain; Plato avoids vilifying opponents. The Apology proper now begins.
