- Editorial framing: Claims that Plato wrote Apology during the trial lack evidence; Schleiermacher’s view that Plato reproduced Socrates’ words verbatim is unconvincing. Plato’s dialogues show no personal vilification of Aristophanes, Anytus, or Meletus (e.g., Aristophanes appears amicably in Symposium). The Apology proper begins.

- Socrates’ opening: He disavows rhetorical ornament, asks to be judged on truth not style, and to be allowed to speak in his ordinary manner (he is over 70 and new to courts).

- Two accuser groups: the long-standing slanderers (more dangerous) and the formal accusers. The older prejudice stems from comic portrayals (Aristophanes) of Socrates as a natural philosopher and sophistic arguer, fostering suspicion of impiety.

- Denials: He has not pursued physical speculation, nor taught for pay. He contrasts himself with fee-taking Sophists (Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias) and reports Callias claiming Evenus of Paros teaches virtue for five minae; Socrates says he lacks such teachable wisdom.

- Oracle and mission: Chaerephon asked Delphi; the Pythia said no man was wiser. Socrates tested reputed wise men (beginning with politicians), finding they thought they knew what they did not. His “wisdom” is knowing he does not know; this inquiry, undertaken as obedience to the god, bred enmity. He found lesser-regarded people often wiser. He then turned to poets, probing the meaning of their own verses.
