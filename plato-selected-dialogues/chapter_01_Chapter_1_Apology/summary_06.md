- Socrates substantiates his claim that public life would have killed an honest man by citing two acts of defiance against illegality:  
  - As prytanis during the Arginusae aftermath, he alone opposed the unlawful collective trial of the generals, resisting threats and popular clamor.  
  - Under the Thirty, he refused an order (with four others) to arrest Leon of Salamis for execution, going home instead—risking death until the regime fell.

- He reiterates he has no “disciples,” teaches nothing privately, and converses freely with anyone without pay; outcomes in others’ character are not imputable to him.

- Challenge to the corruption charge: if he harmed youths, now-grown pupils or their kin would testify. He points to numerous present supporters (e.g., Crito and Critobulus; Lysanias; Antiphon; Nicostratus; Paralus; Adeimantus—Plato’s brother; Aeantodorus), noting Meletus produced none.

- He refuses courtroom supplication or parading his sons, calling such pleas dishonorable and corrupting of jurors’ oaths; to win acquittal by entreaty would itself model impiety. He affirms belief in the gods more truly than his accusers.

- Verdict and penalty phase: he expected conviction but the vote was close; without Anytus and Lycon, Meletus wouldn’t have met the one-fifth threshold. As his “due,” he proposes public maintenance in the Prytaneum, arguing his lifelong benefit to Athenians. He refuses to propose imprisonment, a fine (he’s poor), or exile (he would be expelled everywhere, given his mission).
