- Socrates sharpens his ethical claim: virtues pursued for the sake of trading fears and pleasures are mere shadows; only wisdom yields true virtue. In the “true exchange,” temperance, justice, courage, and wisdom themselves purge the soul of bodily attachments. He invokes mystery-language: the uninitiated sink “in a slough,” while the purified “dwell with the gods”—the true “mystics” are philosophers. Hence his serenity about death: he expects good masters and friends beyond.
- Cebes objects that many fear the soul disperses at death “like smoke,” so proofs are needed that it survives with power and intelligence.
- Socrates begins with the cyclical generation from opposites: as waking comes from sleep and vice versa, so life from death and death from life. If processes went only one way, all would collapse into a single state; thus the living must come from the dead, implying souls exist in the interim.
- He then revives recollection: careful questioning reveals latent knowledge; recollection arises from likeness or unlikeness (e.g., a lyre recalls its owner). From imperfect sensible “equals” we form the concept of absolute Equality, which never appears unequal. Our judgment that sensibles “fall short” presupposes prior knowledge of the Form, implying the soul knew it before embodiment—supporting preexistence and thus survivability beyond death.
