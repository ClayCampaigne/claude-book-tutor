<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
After a 30‑day stay for the Delian festival, Phaedo recounts Socrates’ final day to Echecrates. Friends gather (Simmias, Cebes, Crito, Apollodorus, Euclid, Terpsion, others); Plato is absent, Xanthippe is sent away. Freed from chains, Socrates notes pleasure follows pain, foreshadowing his theme of opposites. He has been versifying Aesop to obey a recurring dream to “practice music,” and sends Evenus word to “follow” him—not by suicide, which is unlawful because we are possessions of the gods.

Socrates defines death as the soul’s separation from the body and claims philosophy is a lifelong practice of dying: purifying the soul from the senses and appetites to grasp immutable realities (Justice, Beauty, the Good). True virtue is such purification; mystery language suggests few are true initiates. He argues for the soul’s preexistence and immortality by (1) generation from opposites (life from death), (2) recollection (our grasp of Forms presupposes prior knowledge), and (3) affinity (the soul, simple and akin to the divine, is less liable to dissolution than the composite, changing body). Pure souls join the gods; impure souls linger and are reincarnated according to character.

Simmias objects that the soul is a “harmony” of the body; Cebes fears it may outlast many bodies yet finally perish. Warning against misology (hatred of argument), Socrates refutes harmony (it admits degrees, cannot oppose its parts, and conflicts with preexistence) and meets Cebes by recounting his turn from natural science to a “safe” causal method grounded in Forms. From the rule that contraries never admit one another, he extends “exclusion” to bearers: as fire will not admit cold and the odd will not admit even, so the soul, the bearer of life, will not admit death. If the immortal is imperishable, the soul withdraws intact at death. Hence the ethical charge: adorn the soul with wisdom and justice.

A mythic eschatology follows—true earth above, Tartarus below, rivers and judgments, purgations and higher abodes—offered as likely in kind. Calmly, Socrates drinks the hemlock, reminding Crito to sacrifice a cock to Asclepius.

Jowett’s reflections temper the dialogue’s proofs: Plato’s logical cast invites tensions (generation vs exclusion of opposites); pictorial afterlives mislead; the soundest modern ground for hope is moral—belief in a good God and the soul’s educative progress beyond death—while the drama’s serene witness remains the most compelling exhortation to live for the soul.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Frame and setting: After a 30-day delay for the Delian festival, Phaedo narrates Socrates’ final day to Echecrates at Phlius. Present are Simmias, Cebes, Crito, Apollodorus, Hermogenes, Euclid, Terpsion, and others; Plato, Aristippus, and Cleombrotus are absent. Xanthippe is sent away with the children.
- Socrates, freed from chains, notes pleasure follows pain (foreshadowing the “opposites” theme). He has been versifying Aesop to obey a recurring dream to “practice music.” He tells Evenus to “follow” him in death—clarified as not by suicide, which is unlawful because we are possessions of the gods (or prisoners who must not self-release).
- Core thesis: Death = separation of soul from body; the philosopher seeks this, purifying from senses and appetites. Virtues are purifications; mysteries hint “few are true initiates.”
- Arguments for the soul’s preexistence/immortality:
  - From opposites: life arises from death as waking from sleep; otherwise all would end in death.
  - Recollection: we recognize Forms (e.g., Equality) beyond sensible equals, implying prior knowledge before birth.
- Affinity argument: Soul (simple, commanding, invisible, akin to divine) is less liable to dissolution than the composite, changing body; pure souls join the gods, impure souls linger as ghosts and reincarnate according to character.
- Objections:
  - Simmias’ harmony: soul as harmony of the body cannot outlast the lyre.
  - Cebes’ weaver/coat: soul may outlast many bodies yet still finally perish; true immortality requires outliving all bodies.
- Socrates warns against misology and invites rigorous refutation; Simmias and Cebes restate their challenges.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Socrates urges rigorous testing to avoid “misology,” then dismantles Simmias’ “harmony” theory:
  - It conflicts with admitted preexistence of Forms/soul; harmony is an effect, but soul is a cause and leader.
  - Harmony admits degrees; souls do not. Souls can oppose bodily impulses (e.g., Odysseus rebuking his heart), which a mere harmony could not.
- Turning to Cebes’ “weaver/coat” worry, Socrates recounts his turn from natural science to a “safe” causal method:
  - Disappointed by Anaxagoras’ material explanations, he distinguishes true causes from mere conditions (bones/muscles vs choosing justice).
  - Adopts the method of hypothesis grounded in Forms: Beauty makes things beautiful, Greatness great, etc.; test consistency, ascend to higher hypotheses.
- New argument: mutual exclusion extended from pure opposites to their inseparable participants:
  - As fire (heat) cannot admit cold, and 3 (odd) cannot admit even, so the soul, whose inseparable attribute is life, cannot admit death.
  - If the immortal is imperishable, the soul does not perish at death but “withdraws.”
- Ethical and eschatological close:
  - Souls are judged; incurables remain in Tartarus; curables undergo purgation and seek victims’ forgiveness; pure souls dwell above; a select few in higher “mansions.”
  - Cosmology of the true earth and rivers (Oceanus, Acheron, Pyriphlegethon, Cocytus/Styx) frames the cycle.
  - Socrates treats the myth as likely in kind, not literally exact; exhorts living for the soul’s good.
  - Final acts: dismisses concern over burial (“you bury my body, not me”); drinks hemlock; asks for a cock to Asclepius—signaling fulfilled piety or “cure” in death.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Closing of the scene: As the hemlock hour arrives, Socrates declines to discuss “how to bury him,” insisting they will bury only his body. He accepts customary washing/burial but makes no literal libation of the poison (only “in spirit”). His final request—a cock to Asclepius—is framed as either an ironic settling of a minor piety or a symbol that death is a “cure.”

- Jowett’s reflective theses on immortality:
  1) Widespread belief resists scrutiny, yet has a historical development; bad arguments breed misology, so first principles must be repeatedly re-examined with rigor.
  2) Traditional props (ecclesial authority, social utility, disputed “historical fact,” material analogies like seed/butterfly) have waned in a scientific age; immortality must be re-grounded in the nature of God and moral first principles.
  3) Immortality is not “fame,” which is brief and selective.
  4) Deep conceptual puzzles persist about soul–body relations (various models surveyed: Platonic separability, Aristotelian entelechy, harmony/monad, sight–eye, boatman–boat, pantheism vs personal survival); any extreme union/separation distorts human nature; Plato mixes myth and argument.
  5) What in us is immortal—personal self, universal spirit, knowledge, goodness, sheer life, consciousness, likeness to God? Moral stakes imply some persistence of evil or educative afterlife; sympathy suggests universal hope; speculative puzzles include animals and the “origin of evil,” pressing the limits of logic.
  6) Analogies are suggestive but inadequate; physiology dispels errors yet finds no “seed” of immortality; many rely on the consensus of the wise, linkage to God, and love’s intuition—at best approximations to a common sentiment.
  7) “Immortality” exceeds our grasp; infinite time/space lose distinctness to thought.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Completes thesis 6: Many accept immortality on the consensus of the wise, its tie to belief in God, and love’s refusal to doubt the continued existence of the beloved; yet arguments and analogies are only approximations to a common human sentiment. That we live again seems more certain than any specific postmortem form.

- 7) Clarifies “immortality”: infinite time or timeless existence is inconceivable; consider instead finite spans (100–1000 years). Traditional depictions (endless torments or ceaseless praise) are incoherent: we lack any model of pains that don’t deaden or pleasures that don’t cloy; crude binaries (wholly good/wholly wicked) replace real gradations. Such images rarely motivate conduct; age dulls both fears and hopes, and most meet death with ordinary resignation.

- 8) Future life should be conceived intellectually, not pictorially: as education/progress from ignorance/evil to knowledge/good. By analogy with human history and probable futures—growing knowledge, moral improvement, social advances—punishments are educational, not retaliatory; “vindictive” governance, or long-delayed, meaningless penalties, contradict the observed order of law and progress. Suffering may occur, but not hopelessly or interminably.

- 9) Reply to “no analogy from seen to unseen”: the soul partakes of the ideal/invisible; its worth is inestimable and irreducible to brain processes. Consciousness of truth, justice, and love (of God) deepens awareness of immortality.

- 10) Strongest ground: divine perfection. A good God wills rational beings to become like himself; “evil” is degrees of imperfect good within ongoing progress. God is justice, truth, love, order, and progress manifest in nature and soul; belief in immortality rests on this moral governance continuing beyond death.

- 11) Epilogue: given human limits, speak modestly; beliefs in immortality vary in degree and form, and people rarely dwell on them even near death.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- The immortality of the soul ultimately rests on belief in a good, wise God whose moral government entails human moral progress; such governance does not cease at death.
- 11) Given our cognitive limits, modesty is fitting: people rarely speak much of immortality, beliefs vary in strength and form, and often fluctuate across life stages. Some simply trust God; some hope to “know friends” again; others reject divine personality yet hold moral ideals as real, yielding a figurative hope. Near death, fear is uncommon; bodily conditions shape last thoughts; pain and age loosen attachment to life.
- 12) Grounds for hope: our relation to God, observable moral/intellectual progress, the depth of moral ideas akin to God’s nature, a higher law within/above physical law, the mind’s capacity for universal contemplation, and convergences across higher religions suggest a human destiny distinct from animals, despite lingering fears of annihilation. Denial drains life’s meaning.
- 13) Abandon pictorial afterlife imagery; think in ideas: rest from pain; the departed as their best selves; continued loving service of God; and our rare moments of union with the divine as the closest intimation of immortality.
- 14) In Phaedo, Plato faces the same tensions (materialism vs. mind, cause vs. effect), linking afterlife to epistemology; as focus shifts to eternal Forms, individuality recedes, then myth returns at the end—an inconsistency we too share.
- 15–16) Greek background mixed popular, mystery, and philosophical strands (Orphic rewards/punishments; Presocratic soul theories; Nous; transmigration; ethical needs), yet belief in personal survival remained weak and fluid; Plato glides between individual and absolute soul.
- 17) Plato’s logical casting invites fallacies: his “generation from opposites” argument conflicts with the later “mutual exclusion” (opposites cannot admit each other).
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Ancient context: Greek writers (esp. Aristotle) are relatively silent on personal immortality; Plato and Aristotle are no farther apart on it than on epistemology.
- Plato’s method and its limits: He casts immortality in early logical terms tied to the Theory of Ideas, inviting “verbal” fallacies—confusing alternation with generation of opposites, and then with their mutual exclusion. This pushes from a personal soul to an abstract “absolute soul” (idea-bearer), a stage-bound notion. Recollection is treated as a pre-scientific hypothesis about abstract ideas. His “crowning” claim—soul immortal because it contains imperishability—and “beauty causes the beautiful” express Eleatic permanence over Heraclitean flux, privileging internal consistency over experiential causes.
- Modern reframing: “If eternal ideas, then eternal souls,” parallels “If God, then immortality.” One may be more certain of ideas/right/truth than of God; indeed, right/truth = God.
- Composite proof in Phaedo: Main support comes from participation in eternal Ideas, supplemented (not always coherently) by ethical and mythic elements. Dialectic can be translated into idealist (Hegelian) terms; myth into poetic; the ethical remains directly compelling.
- Two ethical supports: (1) the philosopher’s ascetic aspiration as a foretaste of immortality (with a slippage between “bare” and virtuous souls); (2) the need for postmortem retribution, presented in moderated myth as “something of the kind.”
- Dramatic frame: Socrates’ serene elevation, gentle traits, and relationships (Crito, jailer, Apollodorus, Phaedo) reinforce his character; Simmias’ and Cebes’ Pythagorean objections provoke a crisis of confidence (misology) before resolution.
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Interlocutors and roles: Simmias (argument-loving, Pythagorean; raises “harmony” view and stresses human fallibility) and Cebes (more rigorous, skeptical; poses suicide query, supports recollection, offers “weaver/coat” mortality worry). Cebes is ultimately persuaded; Simmias grants only qualified assent.
- Historicity and framing: Plato notes his own absence (a sorrowful signal and hint the report isn’t literal). List of attendees and absentees recurs; Apollodorus is overwrought; Phaedo is composed but grieving. Execution was delayed by the sacred Delian voyage: once the priest crowns Theseus’ ship, no executions occur until the vessel returns, sometimes after a long, weather-dependent interval.
- Placement in Plato’s corpus: Phaedo belongs to an “intermediate” period where the Theory of Ideas is fully developed; whether Socrates himself taught immortality is uncertain (Xenophon gives parallels). Reading chains link Meno–Phaedrus–Phaedo (immortality with Ideas) and relate Apology, Republic, Timaeus, Theaetetus, Symposium on differing grounds for immortality.
- Argumental arc: from mysteries/Heraclitean opposites to Pythagorean harmony/transmigration, to recollection, to Anaxagoras’ Nous, culminating in the soul’s inseparability from Ideas; myth closes the discussion.
- Two enduring difficulties: (1) bridging sensible and intelligible (relations, hypotheses, measures); (2) proving teleology (“power of the best”) by facts—Plato retreats to Ideas.
- Dramatic artistry: unified, tragic form; “art concealing art.” Socrates is more confident than his arguments; we’re invited to trust the kind of truth, not literal details.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Emotional and dramatic setup: The friends experience mixed joy and sorrow as they gather; Apollodorus is especially overwrought. Attendees include Crito and Critobulus, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, Antisthenes, Ctesippus, Menexenus; from abroad Simmias, Cebes, Phaedondes, Euclid, Terpsion. Plato is ill; Aristippus and Cleombrotus are in Aegina.
- Last-day procedure: They arrive early after hearing the Delian ship returned; the Eleven remove Socrates’ chains and order execution that day. Xanthippe, present with a child, is sent away lamenting. Socrates notes the linkage of pain and pleasure (chain-pain followed by relief), hinting at the “opposites” theme.
- Poetry motive: He has been versifying Aesop and a hymn to Apollo to satisfy a recurring dream to “practice music,” hedging that philosophy is the highest “music” but obeying the dream literally before death.
- Message to Evenus: A wise man will be willing to die but must not commit suicide.
- Anti-suicide rationale: We are the gods’ possessions; like a servant/animal, one must await the divine summons. Cebes objects that the wise shouldn’t leave excellent rulers; Socrates replies he goes to better gods and likely better men.
- Crito’s warning about talking is dismissed.
- Transition to argument: Socrates will show that true philosophers “pursue death,” i.e., welcome the soul’s separation, and begins by clarifying what death is.
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Socrates defines death as the separation of soul and body, then argues the true philosopher has long “practiced dying” by withdrawing from bodily pleasures (food, sex, adornment) and focusing on the soul.
- Senses are unreliable “witnesses”; the soul attains truth best when untroubled by sights, sounds, pains, and pleasures, using mind alone to grasp absolutes (Justice, Beauty, Goodness, Greatness, etc.). Hence the body hinders knowledge.
- The body’s needs and lusts cause distraction, disease, and social evils (wars from money-seeking for bodily service). Pure knowledge thus comes only when the soul is free from the body—fully after death; in life we approach it by minimal bodily communion.
- Purification = the soul’s separation from the body; philosophers alone systematically pursue this, so death should not terrify them. Fear of death reveals love of body, wealth, or power.
- Conventional courage and temperance are mere trades of one fear/pleasure for another; only wisdom is the “true coin” that makes courage, temperance, and justice genuine. True virtue is a purgation accompanying wisdom.
- Mystery-religion metaphor: many bear thyrsi, few are true “mystics” (i.e., philosophers). The impure cannot approach the pure; Socrates hopes, through a life of purification, to join the gods and will soon learn if he has succeeded.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Socrates sharpens his ethical claim: virtues pursued for the sake of trading fears and pleasures are mere shadows; only wisdom yields true virtue. In the “true exchange,” temperance, justice, courage, and wisdom themselves purge the soul of bodily attachments. He invokes mystery-language: the uninitiated sink “in a slough,” while the purified “dwell with the gods”—the true “mystics” are philosophers. Hence his serenity about death: he expects good masters and friends beyond.
- Cebes objects that many fear the soul disperses at death “like smoke,” so proofs are needed that it survives with power and intelligence.
- Socrates begins with the cyclical generation from opposites: as waking comes from sleep and vice versa, so life from death and death from life. If processes went only one way, all would collapse into a single state; thus the living must come from the dead, implying souls exist in the interim.
- He then revives recollection: careful questioning reveals latent knowledge; recollection arises from likeness or unlikeness (e.g., a lyre recalls its owner). From imperfect sensible “equals” we form the concept of absolute Equality, which never appears unequal. Our judgment that sensibles “fall short” presupposes prior knowledge of the Form, implying the soul knew it before embodiment—supporting preexistence and thus survivability beyond death.
</CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>
- Recollection tightened: From sensible “equals” that fall short, we infer the Form of Equality; this presupposes prior knowledge of Equality. Extending the point, we must have known before birth all the essences grasped in dialectic (Beauty, Goodness, Justice, Holiness, etc.). Since most cannot “give an account” of these now, learning is best understood as recollection of prenatal knowledge lost at birth.
- Forms–soul linkage: The necessity that Forms exist prior to sensible experience is “the same” as the necessity that the soul existed prior to birth; if the Forms did not preexist, neither would the soul. Simmias assents to preexistence.
- Toward postmortem survival: Simmias and Cebes still fear dispersal of the soul at death. Socrates argues that, combined with the earlier “from opposites” thesis (the living are born from the dead), preexistence implies postmortem existence (to be reborn, the soul must persist). He nonetheless agrees to probe the fear, urging a lifelong “charm” against it.
- Affinity setup: Distinguish composite/changing/seen vs. simple/unchanging/unseen. Forms are unchanging; sensibles constantly change. The body is akin to the seen/changing; the soul to the unseen/unchanging. When the soul uses senses, it is dragged into change and confusion; when it turns inward, it communes with purity, eternity, and immortality—this is wisdom. Hence the soul is far more like the unchangeable and, by nature, rules; the body serves.
</CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>
- Completing the “affinity” case: The soul, when it turns inward apart from the senses, communes with what is pure, eternal, unchanging—this is wisdom. By nature the soul rules (divine), the body serves (mortal). Hence the soul is like the divine—immortal, intellectual, uniform, indissoluble—while the body is mortal, multiform, dissoluble, changeable.

- Corpse vs. soul: Even bodies can persist (embalming, bones), so it is implausible the invisible soul would instantly perish. A pure, philosophically trained soul (practicing “death”) departs to the invisible, divine, rational realm, free from human ills, dwelling with the gods.

- Impure souls: Those attached to bodily pleasures, hostile to intellect, carry a “corporeal” weight that drags them back; they haunt tombs, then are reincarnated according to character:
  - Gluttonous/drunken: into asses and similar animals.
  - Unjust/violent: into wolves, hawks, kites.
  - Habitually just/temperate without philosophy: into gentle social kinds (bees/wasps/ants) or moderate humans.
  - Only true philosophers, purified, join the gods.

- Why philosophers are temperate/brave: Not from fear of poverty/disgrace, but to free the soul. Philosophy loosens the soul “glued” to the body by exposing sensory deception and urging self-reliant intellection. Greatest danger: intense pleasures/pains “nail” the soul to the body, making it take bodily deliverances as truest, impeding purity and leading to rebirth.

- Resolve: The philosopher calms passion, follows reason, contemplates the divine, and so will not be scattered at death.

- Transition: Socrates invites further objections; Simmias/Cebes hesitate. Socrates, like Apollo’s swans, rejoices before death, claiming prophetic cheer rather than lament.
</CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>
- Socrates likens himself to Apollo’s swans who sing most joyfully before death because they prophetically foresee good; he, as Apollo’s servant, welcomes questioning while time remains.
- Simmias’ stance: Absolute certainty about such matters is likely impossible, yet one must test to the utmost; failing divine revelation, adopt the best, most irrefutable human “raft.” His objection (harmony theory): the soul is a harmony produced by the bodily elements (hot/cold, wet/dry), like harmony in a lyre. When the body’s “strings” are loosened or broken (disease/death), the harmony perishes first; thus the soul would not outlast bodily dissolution.
- Socrates defers full reply until hearing Cebes.
- Cebes’ objection (weaver/coat): Even if the soul is stronger and outlasts many bodies, it might still finally perish—like a weaver who outlives several coats but is ultimately outlived by the last. Hence confidence at death is rash unless the soul is shown imperishable, not merely long-lived.
- The company’s confidence wavers; Echecrates concurs.
- Socrates responds with composure and humor, then warns against “misology” (hatred of arguments), akin to misanthropy: naive overtrust and repeated disappointment breed sweeping distrust. Few arguments are extremely good or bad; most lie in between—so persist in careful dialectic rather than despair.
</CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>
- Extending the misology caution, Socrates notes extremes are rare; most things lie in the mean. Unlike people, novice dialecticians, after seeing some arguments fail, can slide into global skepticism (the “Euripus” flux). One should blame one’s own lack of skill, not arguments, and strive for “health of mind.”
- Socrates frames his stance: he argues chiefly to persuade himself; even if no afterlife exists, his composure benefits friends and any error “dies with him.” He invites strong refutation to avoid “stinging” others like a bee.
- He secures Simmias’ and Cebes’ continued assent to recollection (preexistence), then shows Simmias’ “harmony” view contradicts it: a harmony cannot precede its elements; it is produced last and perishes first. Simmias abandons the harmony theory as merely plausible versus recollection’s firmer grounds.
- Further dismantling harmony:
  - A harmony only follows its parts; it cannot oppose them or possess qualities contrary to them.
  - Harmony admits degrees; souls do not admit degrees of “soulhood.” This would erase differences of virtue/vice or make vice impossible—absurd.
  - The soul rules and often resists bodily impulses (e.g., Odysseus reproaching his heart), which a harmony could not; thus the soul is not a harmony.
- With “Harmonia” refuted, Socrates turns to Cebes’ remaining “Cadmus” objection: even a long-lived, preexistent soul might ultimately perish; embodiment could be a dissolving “disease.” True immortality (imperishability) still needs proof.
</CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 15 SUMMARY>
- Socrates restates Cebes’ “Cadmus” worry: proofs of the soul’s preexistence, strength, and long life don’t establish imperishability; embodiment might be a dissolving “disease,” so a wise person should still fear death absent a strict account of immortality. Cebes agrees.
- To address this, Socrates recounts his intellectual turn:
  - As a youth he pursued “natural” causes (hot/cold, blood/air/fire, brain, etc.), then realized he was confusing causes and conditions, even in simple cases (e.g., why 1+1=2; addition vs division both seeming to “cause” two).
  - He embraced Anaxagoras’ claim that Mind (Nous) is the cause and disposer of all—expecting teleological explanations (“for the best”). But he was disappointed to find merely material accounts (air, ether, water).
  - He illustrates the cause/condition confusion: explaining his sitting by bones and muscles ignores the true cause—his choice to obey the city’s judgment as best.
- Lacking a satisfying account of “the best,” he adopts a “second-best” method to protect the “eye of the soul”: turn from senses to thought and use hypothesis-testing.
  - Assume the strongest principles: there are absolutes (Beauty, Goodness, Greatness, etc.).
  - Causal rule: things are F by participating in the Form F; participation (not colors, shapes, or mechanics) makes beautiful things beautiful. He treats this as the “safest” causal account.
- He will use this Form-based method to resolve Cebes’ challenge and prove the soul’s immortality.
</CHUNK 15 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 16 SUMMARY>
- Socrates restates his “safe” causal principle: things are F only by the presence/participation of the Form F (beauty makes beautiful; greatness makes great; smallness makes small). He rejects explanatory appeals to material features (colors, shapes, “a head’s length,” arithmetic operations), insisting on Form-participation as cause.
- Methodological rule: don’t confuse principles with their consequences (as Eristics do); test whether consequences cohere and, if pressed, ascend to higher hypotheses until reaching the best principle.
- He distinguishes two discussions: earlier, about sensibles “becoming” from opposites; now, about essential opposites that never admit one another. Agreement: an opposite never becomes its own opposite.
- He extends “exclusion” from pure opposites to “bearers” that necessarily bring a property: snow (by bearing cold) won’t admit heat; fire (heat) won’t admit cold; the number three (odd) won’t admit even, nor two admit odd; five/ten likewise; certain ratios won’t admit “wholeness.” Such bearers either withdraw or perish rather than accept the contrary.
- Hence, give better causal answers: body is hot by fire, diseased by fever, numbers odd by the monad.
- Application set-up: that which renders a body alive is the soul; since life has an opposite, the stage is set to argue the soul cannot admit death.
</CHUNK 16 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 17 SUMMARY>
- Completing the “exclusion” proof, Socrates shifts from naming properties to naming the bearers that cause them: not “heat” but “fire,” not “disease” but “fever,” not “oddness” but “the monad.” By parity, that which makes a body alive is the soul; since life’s opposite is death, and a bearer never admits the opposite of what it brings, the soul does not admit death. Therefore it is immortal.
- Further step: if the immortal is also imperishable (as gods and men admit of God, Life itself, and “the immortal” generally), then the soul, being immortal, is imperishable. Hence at death the mortal part perishes, the immortal soul withdraws intact. Cebes assents; Simmias has modest residual hesitation, and Socrates counsels careful but confident reliance on clear first principles.
- Ethical turn: Immortality heightens responsibility. If death ended all, the wicked would profit; but now only virtue and wisdom free the soul from evil. The soul carries only its nurture and education into death; a personal daimon leads to judgment, then to the underworld, and after appointed periods souls return by appointed guides. The path has many branchings: pure, orderly souls proceed straight; body-loving or impure souls are dragged, shunned, wander until their time, then go to fitting abodes; pure and just souls have proper homes.
- Cosmology preface and “true earth”: Earth is spherical at the cosmos’ center by equipoise. We live in hollows—sediment under “air” we mistake for heaven—where things are corroded like the sea-bottom. Above lies the pure, luminous “true earth” in ether: brilliantly colored lands, purer stones and metals, more beautiful growths, and inhabitants who use air as we use water, with ether to them as air is to us.
</CHUNK 17 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 18 SUMMARY>
- Upper world vs. ours: Above the hollows where we live, the “true earth” has purer, brilliantly colored stones and metals; our gems are mere corrupted fragments. Its inhabitants use air as we use water; ether to them is as air to us. They are healthier, longer-lived, with keener senses; gods truly dwell in their temples, converse with them, and they see the heavens as they are.

- Subterranean system and cause: The earth’s interior has connected basins and channels through a vast central chasm (Tartarus). Water and air lack a stable bed and oscillate like respiration, driving periodic in-and-out flows that fill hollows “like a pump,” forming seas, lakes, rivers, springs, fires, and mud streams.

- Four great rivers and afterlife routes:
  - Oceanus encircles the earth.
  - Acheron runs to the Acherusian lake; most souls go there to await rebirth, undergoing purifications and proportionate rewards/penalties.
  - Pyriphlegethon (fiery) loops and returns to Tartarus.
  - Cocytus/Styx (dark-blue, unmixing) likewise circles and returns.
  - Incurables (heinous sacrilege/murders) are cast forever into Tartarus. Remediable great offenders suffer a year in Tartarus, then via Cocytus/Pyriphlegethon beg their victims at the Acherusian lake; release depends on forgiveness. The holy go to a purer region above; the philosophically purified live bodiless in indescribably fair “mansions.”

- Exhortation: Given the soul’s immortality, it is reasonable to trust “something of the kind” and to adorn the soul with temperance, justice, courage, nobility, and truth, renouncing bodily ornaments.

- Final preparations: Socrates will bathe to spare the women after hemlock. To Crito: no special commands—care for yourselves by living rightly. On burial, he jokes they must “catch” only his body; avoid saying “we bury Socrates.” He bids farewell to family; the respectful jailer arrives to administer the poison.
</CHUNK 18 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 19 SUMMARY>
- After bathing, Socrates meets his family (two young sons and an older one) and the women, gives brief instructions in Crito’s presence, then dismisses them.
- Near sunset, the jailer arrives, praises Socrates’ gentleness, and tearfully delivers the order to drink the hemlock. Socrates responds kindly and asks Crito to have the cup brought without delay.
- Crito urges postponement (as others do to prolong life), but Socrates refuses, saying delay gains nothing and would be ridiculous given a life already forfeit.
- The attendant instructs him to walk until his legs grow heavy, then lie down. Socrates asks if he may make a libation; told the dose is exact, he instead prays that the gods prosper his journey to the next world and drinks the poison calmly and cheerfully.
- Friends break down; Socrates rebukes the outcry, insisting on a peaceful death. He walks, then lies down; the attendant checks the ascending numbness. Socrates notes the end will come when the poison reaches the heart.
- Final words: “Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius; see that it is paid.” Crito assents. Socrates dies; Phaedo concludes he was the wisest, justest, and best of men he knew.
