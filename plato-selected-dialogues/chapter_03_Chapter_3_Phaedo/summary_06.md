- Ancient context: Greek writers (esp. Aristotle) are relatively silent on personal immortality; Plato and Aristotle are no farther apart on it than on epistemology.
- Plato’s method and its limits: He casts immortality in early logical terms tied to the Theory of Ideas, inviting “verbal” fallacies—confusing alternation with generation of opposites, and then with their mutual exclusion. This pushes from a personal soul to an abstract “absolute soul” (idea-bearer), a stage-bound notion. Recollection is treated as a pre-scientific hypothesis about abstract ideas. His “crowning” claim—soul immortal because it contains imperishability—and “beauty causes the beautiful” express Eleatic permanence over Heraclitean flux, privileging internal consistency over experiential causes.
- Modern reframing: “If eternal ideas, then eternal souls,” parallels “If God, then immortality.” One may be more certain of ideas/right/truth than of God; indeed, right/truth = God.
- Composite proof in Phaedo: Main support comes from participation in eternal Ideas, supplemented (not always coherently) by ethical and mythic elements. Dialectic can be translated into idealist (Hegelian) terms; myth into poetic; the ethical remains directly compelling.
- Two ethical supports: (1) the philosopher’s ascetic aspiration as a foretaste of immortality (with a slippage between “bare” and virtuous souls); (2) the need for postmortem retribution, presented in moderated myth as “something of the kind.”
- Dramatic frame: Socrates’ serene elevation, gentle traits, and relationships (Crito, jailer, Apollodorus, Phaedo) reinforce his character; Simmias’ and Cebes’ Pythagorean objections provoke a crisis of confidence (misology) before resolution.
