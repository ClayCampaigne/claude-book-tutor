- Completes thesis 6: Many accept immortality on the consensus of the wise, its tie to belief in God, and love’s refusal to doubt the continued existence of the beloved; yet arguments and analogies are only approximations to a common human sentiment. That we live again seems more certain than any specific postmortem form.

- 7) Clarifies “immortality”: infinite time or timeless existence is inconceivable; consider instead finite spans (100–1000 years). Traditional depictions (endless torments or ceaseless praise) are incoherent: we lack any model of pains that don’t deaden or pleasures that don’t cloy; crude binaries (wholly good/wholly wicked) replace real gradations. Such images rarely motivate conduct; age dulls both fears and hopes, and most meet death with ordinary resignation.

- 8) Future life should be conceived intellectually, not pictorially: as education/progress from ignorance/evil to knowledge/good. By analogy with human history and probable futures—growing knowledge, moral improvement, social advances—punishments are educational, not retaliatory; “vindictive” governance, or long-delayed, meaningless penalties, contradict the observed order of law and progress. Suffering may occur, but not hopelessly or interminably.

- 9) Reply to “no analogy from seen to unseen”: the soul partakes of the ideal/invisible; its worth is inestimable and irreducible to brain processes. Consciousness of truth, justice, and love (of God) deepens awareness of immortality.

- 10) Strongest ground: divine perfection. A good God wills rational beings to become like himself; “evil” is degrees of imperfect good within ongoing progress. God is justice, truth, love, order, and progress manifest in nature and soul; belief in immortality rests on this moral governance continuing beyond death.

- 11) Epilogue: given human limits, speak modestly; beliefs in immortality vary in degree and form, and people rarely dwell on them even near death.
