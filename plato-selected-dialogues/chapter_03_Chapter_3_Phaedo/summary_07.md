- Interlocutors and roles: Simmias (argument-loving, Pythagorean; raises “harmony” view and stresses human fallibility) and Cebes (more rigorous, skeptical; poses suicide query, supports recollection, offers “weaver/coat” mortality worry). Cebes is ultimately persuaded; Simmias grants only qualified assent.
- Historicity and framing: Plato notes his own absence (a sorrowful signal and hint the report isn’t literal). List of attendees and absentees recurs; Apollodorus is overwrought; Phaedo is composed but grieving. Execution was delayed by the sacred Delian voyage: once the priest crowns Theseus’ ship, no executions occur until the vessel returns, sometimes after a long, weather-dependent interval.
- Placement in Plato’s corpus: Phaedo belongs to an “intermediate” period where the Theory of Ideas is fully developed; whether Socrates himself taught immortality is uncertain (Xenophon gives parallels). Reading chains link Meno–Phaedrus–Phaedo (immortality with Ideas) and relate Apology, Republic, Timaeus, Theaetetus, Symposium on differing grounds for immortality.
- Argumental arc: from mysteries/Heraclitean opposites to Pythagorean harmony/transmigration, to recollection, to Anaxagoras’ Nous, culminating in the soul’s inseparability from Ideas; myth closes the discussion.
- Two enduring difficulties: (1) bridging sensible and intelligible (relations, hypotheses, measures); (2) proving teleology (“power of the best”) by facts—Plato retreats to Ideas.
- Dramatic artistry: unified, tragic form; “art concealing art.” Socrates is more confident than his arguments; we’re invited to trust the kind of truth, not literal details.
