- The immortality of the soul ultimately rests on belief in a good, wise God whose moral government entails human moral progress; such governance does not cease at death.
- 11) Given our cognitive limits, modesty is fitting: people rarely speak much of immortality, beliefs vary in strength and form, and often fluctuate across life stages. Some simply trust God; some hope to “know friends” again; others reject divine personality yet hold moral ideals as real, yielding a figurative hope. Near death, fear is uncommon; bodily conditions shape last thoughts; pain and age loosen attachment to life.
- 12) Grounds for hope: our relation to God, observable moral/intellectual progress, the depth of moral ideas akin to God’s nature, a higher law within/above physical law, the mind’s capacity for universal contemplation, and convergences across higher religions suggest a human destiny distinct from animals, despite lingering fears of annihilation. Denial drains life’s meaning.
- 13) Abandon pictorial afterlife imagery; think in ideas: rest from pain; the departed as their best selves; continued loving service of God; and our rare moments of union with the divine as the closest intimation of immortality.
- 14) In Phaedo, Plato faces the same tensions (materialism vs. mind, cause vs. effect), linking afterlife to epistemology; as focus shifts to eternal Forms, individuality recedes, then myth returns at the end—an inconsistency we too share.
- 15–16) Greek background mixed popular, mystery, and philosophical strands (Orphic rewards/punishments; Presocratic soul theories; Nous; transmigration; ethical needs), yet belief in personal survival remained weak and fluid; Plato glides between individual and absolute soul.
- 17) Plato’s logical casting invites fallacies: his “generation from opposites” argument conflicts with the later “mutual exclusion” (opposites cannot admit each other).
