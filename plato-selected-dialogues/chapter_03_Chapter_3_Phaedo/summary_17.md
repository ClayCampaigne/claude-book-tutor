- Completing the “exclusion” proof, Socrates shifts from naming properties to naming the bearers that cause them: not “heat” but “fire,” not “disease” but “fever,” not “oddness” but “the monad.” By parity, that which makes a body alive is the soul; since life’s opposite is death, and a bearer never admits the opposite of what it brings, the soul does not admit death. Therefore it is immortal.
- Further step: if the immortal is also imperishable (as gods and men admit of God, Life itself, and “the immortal” generally), then the soul, being immortal, is imperishable. Hence at death the mortal part perishes, the immortal soul withdraws intact. Cebes assents; Simmias has modest residual hesitation, and Socrates counsels careful but confident reliance on clear first principles.
- Ethical turn: Immortality heightens responsibility. If death ended all, the wicked would profit; but now only virtue and wisdom free the soul from evil. The soul carries only its nurture and education into death; a personal daimon leads to judgment, then to the underworld, and after appointed periods souls return by appointed guides. The path has many branchings: pure, orderly souls proceed straight; body-loving or impure souls are dragged, shunned, wander until their time, then go to fitting abodes; pure and just souls have proper homes.
- Cosmology preface and “true earth”: Earth is spherical at the cosmos’ center by equipoise. We live in hollows—sediment under “air” we mistake for heaven—where things are corroded like the sea-bottom. Above lies the pure, luminous “true earth” in ether: brilliantly colored lands, purer stones and metals, more beautiful growths, and inhabitants who use air as we use water, with ether to them as air is to us.
