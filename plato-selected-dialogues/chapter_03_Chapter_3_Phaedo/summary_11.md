- Recollection tightened: From sensible “equals” that fall short, we infer the Form of Equality; this presupposes prior knowledge of Equality. Extending the point, we must have known before birth all the essences grasped in dialectic (Beauty, Goodness, Justice, Holiness, etc.). Since most cannot “give an account” of these now, learning is best understood as recollection of prenatal knowledge lost at birth.
- Forms–soul linkage: The necessity that Forms exist prior to sensible experience is “the same” as the necessity that the soul existed prior to birth; if the Forms did not preexist, neither would the soul. Simmias assents to preexistence.
- Toward postmortem survival: Simmias and Cebes still fear dispersal of the soul at death. Socrates argues that, combined with the earlier “from opposites” thesis (the living are born from the dead), preexistence implies postmortem existence (to be reborn, the soul must persist). He nonetheless agrees to probe the fear, urging a lifelong “charm” against it.
- Affinity setup: Distinguish composite/changing/seen vs. simple/unchanging/unseen. Forms are unchanging; sensibles constantly change. The body is akin to the seen/changing; the soul to the unseen/unchanging. When the soul uses senses, it is dragged into change and confusion; when it turns inward, it communes with purity, eternity, and immortality—this is wisdom. Hence the soul is far more like the unchangeable and, by nature, rules; the body serves.
