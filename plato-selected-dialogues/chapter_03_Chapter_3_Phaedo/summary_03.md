- Closing of the scene: As the hemlock hour arrives, Socrates declines to discuss “how to bury him,” insisting they will bury only his body. He accepts customary washing/burial but makes no literal libation of the poison (only “in spirit”). His final request—a cock to Asclepius—is framed as either an ironic settling of a minor piety or a symbol that death is a “cure.”

- Jowett’s reflective theses on immortality:
  1) Widespread belief resists scrutiny, yet has a historical development; bad arguments breed misology, so first principles must be repeatedly re-examined with rigor.
  2) Traditional props (ecclesial authority, social utility, disputed “historical fact,” material analogies like seed/butterfly) have waned in a scientific age; immortality must be re-grounded in the nature of God and moral first principles.
  3) Immortality is not “fame,” which is brief and selective.
  4) Deep conceptual puzzles persist about soul–body relations (various models surveyed: Platonic separability, Aristotelian entelechy, harmony/monad, sight–eye, boatman–boat, pantheism vs personal survival); any extreme union/separation distorts human nature; Plato mixes myth and argument.
  5) What in us is immortal—personal self, universal spirit, knowledge, goodness, sheer life, consciousness, likeness to God? Moral stakes imply some persistence of evil or educative afterlife; sympathy suggests universal hope; speculative puzzles include animals and the “origin of evil,” pressing the limits of logic.
  6) Analogies are suggestive but inadequate; physiology dispels errors yet finds no “seed” of immortality; many rely on the consensus of the wise, linkage to God, and love’s intuition—at best approximations to a common sentiment.
  7) “Immortality” exceeds our grasp; infinite time/space lose distinctness to thought.
