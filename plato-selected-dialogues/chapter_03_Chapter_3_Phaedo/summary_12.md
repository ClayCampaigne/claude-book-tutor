- Completing the “affinity” case: The soul, when it turns inward apart from the senses, communes with what is pure, eternal, unchanging—this is wisdom. By nature the soul rules (divine), the body serves (mortal). Hence the soul is like the divine—immortal, intellectual, uniform, indissoluble—while the body is mortal, multiform, dissoluble, changeable.

- Corpse vs. soul: Even bodies can persist (embalming, bones), so it is implausible the invisible soul would instantly perish. A pure, philosophically trained soul (practicing “death”) departs to the invisible, divine, rational realm, free from human ills, dwelling with the gods.

- Impure souls: Those attached to bodily pleasures, hostile to intellect, carry a “corporeal” weight that drags them back; they haunt tombs, then are reincarnated according to character:
  - Gluttonous/drunken: into asses and similar animals.
  - Unjust/violent: into wolves, hawks, kites.
  - Habitually just/temperate without philosophy: into gentle social kinds (bees/wasps/ants) or moderate humans.
  - Only true philosophers, purified, join the gods.

- Why philosophers are temperate/brave: Not from fear of poverty/disgrace, but to free the soul. Philosophy loosens the soul “glued” to the body by exposing sensory deception and urging self-reliant intellection. Greatest danger: intense pleasures/pains “nail” the soul to the body, making it take bodily deliverances as truest, impeding purity and leading to rebirth.

- Resolve: The philosopher calms passion, follows reason, contemplates the divine, and so will not be scattered at death.

- Transition: Socrates invites further objections; Simmias/Cebes hesitate. Socrates, like Apollo’s swans, rejoices before death, claiming prophetic cheer rather than lament.
