- Upper world vs. ours: Above the hollows where we live, the “true earth” has purer, brilliantly colored stones and metals; our gems are mere corrupted fragments. Its inhabitants use air as we use water; ether to them is as air to us. They are healthier, longer-lived, with keener senses; gods truly dwell in their temples, converse with them, and they see the heavens as they are.

- Subterranean system and cause: The earth’s interior has connected basins and channels through a vast central chasm (Tartarus). Water and air lack a stable bed and oscillate like respiration, driving periodic in-and-out flows that fill hollows “like a pump,” forming seas, lakes, rivers, springs, fires, and mud streams.

- Four great rivers and afterlife routes:
  - Oceanus encircles the earth.
  - Acheron runs to the Acherusian lake; most souls go there to await rebirth, undergoing purifications and proportionate rewards/penalties.
  - Pyriphlegethon (fiery) loops and returns to Tartarus.
  - Cocytus/Styx (dark-blue, unmixing) likewise circles and returns.
  - Incurables (heinous sacrilege/murders) are cast forever into Tartarus. Remediable great offenders suffer a year in Tartarus, then via Cocytus/Pyriphlegethon beg their victims at the Acherusian lake; release depends on forgiveness. The holy go to a purer region above; the philosophically purified live bodiless in indescribably fair “mansions.”

- Exhortation: Given the soul’s immortality, it is reasonable to trust “something of the kind” and to adorn the soul with temperance, justice, courage, nobility, and truth, renouncing bodily ornaments.

- Final preparations: Socrates will bathe to spare the women after hemlock. To Crito: no special commands—care for yourselves by living rightly. On burial, he jokes they must “catch” only his body; avoid saying “we bury Socrates.” He bids farewell to family; the respectful jailer arrives to administer the poison.
