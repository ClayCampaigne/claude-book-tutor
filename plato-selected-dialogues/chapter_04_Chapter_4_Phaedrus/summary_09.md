- Debate on Lysias: Phaedrus praises Lysias’ exhaustive “repetition”; Socrates insists such commonplaces are unavoidable and merit lies in arrangement, not invention. Pressed by oath, he agrees to deliver a better, different speech, adopting the non‑lover’s thesis.

- Methodical start: Good counsel requires definition. Love is defined as an irrational desire for personal beauty that overcomes reason; in each of us, desire for pleasure contends with opinion guided by reason toward the best—temperance when reason rules, excess when desire rules. Non‑lovers also desire the beautiful/good, but are not ruled by mania.

- Harms caused by the lover:
  - Intellectual/moral: The lover, fearing equality or superiority in the beloved, seeks to keep him inferior—ignorant, timid, inarticulate—jealously cutting him off from associations that would improve him, above all from philosophy.
  - Physical: He fosters delicacy and luxury, avoiding training and toil, producing weakness in crisis.
  - Social/economic: He alienates the beloved from family, friends, and wealth (which lessen his control), preferring him poor, isolated, and dependent.
  - Companionship: Mismatched in years, the lover imposes constant, intrusive presence driven by desire; the beloved endures surveillance, cloying praise, misplaced reproaches, and the lover’s unattractive aging—made worse by indiscretions when drunk.

This sets the non‑lover as the safer, more beneficial choice and models Socrates’ insistence on definition and psychological analysis before rhetoric.
