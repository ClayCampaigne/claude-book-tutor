- Editorial bridge on decline and renewal: The later Greek world lacked the moral-psychic roots of literary excellence—no aspiration, civic energy, consistency, or love of knowledge—so it retreated to authority and tradition, lost true poetry (and thus good prose), confused words with things, and misread or neglected the classics. Literature devolved into compilations, scholia, forgeries, and pedantry fixated on minutiae, hastening the loss of major works. A similar decay could recur, harming national manners. Possible remedies: broaden and improve education (better teacher training, higher standards, cheap press), cultivate latent talent at scale, leverage cooperative intelligence, extend education across generations, intensify global exchange (East/West), increase leisure for mind’s improvement, deepen awe before nature, replace narrow nationalism with philanthropy, reduce prejudice/party spirit, and carry forward the past’s seeds of revival. Thus literature need not die.

- Dialogue begins: Socrates meets Phaedrus, who brings Lysias’ written argument that a non‑lover is preferable to a lover. Socrates jokes, assumes Phaedrus memorized it, and, spotting the roll, insists on hearing the text. They seek shade by the Ilissus, discuss the Boreas–Oreithyia tale; Socrates offers a rationalizing account but dismisses such myth “explanations” as time-wasting, prioritizing the Delphic maxim to know oneself.
