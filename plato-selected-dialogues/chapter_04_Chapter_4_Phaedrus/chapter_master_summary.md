<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Plato’s Phaedrus, a companion to the Symposium, fuses love and philosophy within a critique of rhetoric. Outside Athens’ walls, Phaedrus reads Lysias’ written case that the non‑lover is preferable to the lover—more rational, stable, and less harmful. Socrates mocks myth “rationalizing,” urging self‑knowledge, then faults Lysias’ style and, adopting the non‑lover’s persona, delivers a sharper version: erotic passion is an irrational excess that isolates and weakens the beloved, breeds jealousy and dependence, and, when it cools, curdles into enmity.

Checked by his divine sign for slandering Love, Socrates recants with a palinode: some “madness” is divine and best—prophecy, purificatory rites, poetic inspiration, and most of all erotic mania. He grounds this praise in a psychology and myth. Soul is immortal as the self‑moving source of motion; allegorically it is a charioteer (reason) driving two winged horses (noble and base). In the gods’ celestial procession, souls once glimpsed true being—Justice, Temperance, Knowledge—nourishing their wings; failure led to descent and embodiment. Human lives are ranked by how much truth was seen, with philosophers and true lovers highest; just choices elevate across cycles, unjust sink.

On earth, only Beauty shows clearly enough to awaken recollection. Divine eros makes the lover “grow wings,” prize the beloved above worldly claims, and strive to mold him to a godlike pattern; in the soul’s struggle the noble horse allies with reason against concupiscence. If continent and philosophical, lover and beloved become modest, reverent, and attain the highest human happiness, “winged” together after death; even a less disciplined pair fares well, though lower than the best.

From here the dialogue turns to rhetoric. True speaking begins from truth and requires dialectic: collecting many particulars under one idea and dividing “at the joints.” Handbooks that trade in plausible devices mistake preliminaries for art. Rhetoric is a science of the soul—types, occasions, and fitting speech—aimed at pleasing the gods, not merely the many. Writing, by the Theuth–Thamus myth, is an unresponsive image; living speech, planted in souls, begets understanding. Socrates sends messages to Lysias and prophesies that Isocrates may rise beyond rhetoric toward philosophy, then concludes with a prayer for inward harmony and true wealth.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Framing and setting: Phaedrus pairs with Symposium as Plato’s full treatment of love, blending love and philosophy. Phaedrus, fresh from hearing Lysias, walks with Socrates outside the walls to read Lysias’ written speech. Socrates dismisses myth “rationalizing” (Boreas/Oreithyia), urging the study of the human soul instead.

- Lysias’ thesis and Socrates’ first speech: Lysias argues the non-lover is preferable to the lover (more rational, stable, less harmful, etc.). Socrates critiques its style and content, then, ironically adopting the non-lover’s persona, delivers a better-organized case: love (an irrational excess) corrupts the beloved—isolating him, fostering luxury, jealousy, and dependence—then sours into enmity once passion fades.

- Palinode triggered: As he rises to leave, Socrates’ sign checks him; he owes recompense for “blaspheming” Love. He offers a palinode: certain madnesses are divine gifts—prophecy, purificatory rites, poetic inspiration, and most of all erotic mania.

- Soul myth (core doctrine): All soul is self-moving and immortal; imaged as a charioteer with two winged horses (one noble, one base). In a celestial procession with the gods, souls glimpse the intelligible realities (Justice, Temperance, Knowledge, pure Being). Vision nourishes and feathers the soul’s wings; failure to control the base horse causes descent and embodiment.

- Recollection, lives, and cycles: Souls reincarnate according to how much truth they saw; highest become philosophers/lovers, then king/warrior, down through nine ranks to tyrant. Just lives improve; unjust deteriorate. After judgments and thousand-year intervals, souls choose new lives; thrice-philosophers regain wings in 3,000 years; others after 10,000.

- Beauty and love: Beauty uniquely shows on earth, provoking recollection. True lovers, “mad” with divine eros, feel wing-growth pains, prize the beloved above worldly claims, and love according to the god they formerly followed—leading into the charioteer’s struggle to guide desire.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Divine eros in practice: The lover’s frenzy makes family, wealth, and convention negligible; only the beloved can relieve his wing-growth pains. Lovers’ characters mirror the god they once followed (Zeus → philosophical/royal natures; Ares → fierce, etc.) and they seek matching beloveds, imparting their godlike stamp. In the soul’s charioteer struggle, the base horse presses for gratification; the charioteer, awed by the beloved, restrains and finally bloodies the base horse into submission. With self‑mastery, both become modest and reverent, share the same image of love, and, if continent, attain the highest human happiness and “heavenly victory”; even the more ambitious pair fares well, though inferior. Persevering, they eventually “grow wings” together after death.

- Turn to rhetoric and writing: Socrates recants to honor Love, then critiques rhetoric. Good speaking begins from truth; rhetoric is an enchanting use of likenesses that still presupposes knowledge of truth to deceive or to resist deception. Using Lysias’ and his own speeches, Socrates contrasts disorder with dialectical method: define terms; collect into unities and divide into parts (synthesis/analysis). Handbooks (Polus, Tisias, Gorgias, etc.) mistake preliminaries for art; true rhetoric, like medicine, requires knowing soul‑types, occasions, and aims at pleasing the gods, not mere probability.

- Writing vs speech: The Theuth–Thamus myth grounds speech’s superiority—writing is image-like, fixed, unresponsive, a “bastard” of knowledge; sow in souls, not hotbeds. A good orator must know truth and adapt it to souls; living speech begets living understanding. Messages are sent to Lysias and Isocrates; a prayer closes.

- Unity/theme: Phaedrus interweaves five strands—false rhetoric, divine love, dialectic (collection/division), true rhetoric grounded in dialectic and psychology, and speech’s superiority—rhetoric being the continuous thread. Socrates’ second speech models the higher rhetoric; love aligns with dialectic, ascending from interested love (conventional rhetoric), to disinterested sensory love (poetry), to love of the unseen (dialectic).
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Framing of the three speeches: Lysias’ piece exemplifies false rhetoric; Socrates’ first speech, though better arranged, still shares its defects. Socrates’ second, orderly even amid poetry, models “true rhetoric”: persuasion grounded in truth and in knowledge of character, and ultimately in dialectic.

- Dialectic and love: True rhetoric rests on dialectic, which is a kind of inspiration akin to eros. Philosophy thus absorbs rhetorical “technique” into two higher powers—love of the Ideas and dialectical division/collection.

- Three degrees of love mapped to discourse: (1) interested love ↔ conventional rhetoric; (2) disinterested, “mad” love for sensible beauty ↔ poetry; (3) disinterested love of the unseen ↔ dialectic/science of Forms.

- Rhetorical critique and authorship: The dialogue satirizes contemporary rhetoric’s insipidity, mannerism, and rhythmic parallelism (“more rhythm than reason”). The Lysias speech is likely Plato’s literary fiction, consistent with his use of crafted insertions elsewhere.

- Purpose and irony: Socrates “beats” rhetoricians by better structure (definition, general maxims) but aims higher: both passionate and interested loves are ultimately superseded by a higher, disinterested love. His condemnation of the first two speeches is ironic, clearing space for the palinode.

- Modern transposition (editor’s bridge): Recasting to contemporary terms, a “modern Socrates” might critique marriage driven by passion and praise rational friendship, then offer a palinode to purified “love of minds” aligned with duty/God, culminating in shared ascent and postmortem union—illustrating Plato’s applicability across times when adjusted for manners.

- Return to Phaedrus’ arc: Socrates denounces the initial speeches as blaspheming Love for assuming only self-interested desire; he introduces the myth of divine, enduring eros (to be taken as a parable, not over-literalized).
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Socrates condemns both initial speeches as impious toward Love because they assume love is self-interested; he contrasts them with a divine, disinterested, enduring eros introduced via a myth that should be read as a parable, not pressed in detail.

- Core of the myth: the soul is self-moving and source of motion; then, allegorically, a charioteer (reason) with two horses—black (concupiscence) and white (honor-loving, akin to thumos)—presents an early tripartite psychology. Unlike Parmenides’ chariot, Plato’s is moral-allegorical.

- Preexistence and recollection: souls once followed gods, glimpsed Forms, and now strive to regain that vision; desire hinders, reason with the noble element allies against it. Ideal eros is continent; concessions to desire are second-best. Plato is serious about preexistence, recollection, reason’s primacy, and likely transmigration.

- “Madness” signals inspired faculties (genius/inspiration) beyond rule and also plays on common views of philosophy; some details (souls stamped by a god, playful etymologies) blend irony and allegory.

- Do not literalize cycles (10,000 years) or infer that tyrants can be righteous; weightier are: universals distinguish humans; rational “grace” tends to persevere.

- Proto-doctrinal hints: chance with freedom/responsibility; a moral principle in man (immortal steed); God’s essentially moral nature (contemplation of Justice/Virtue); life as aspiration beyond art; a nascent necessary/contingent distinction; soul as cosmic motive reason. The philosopher appears “mad” or alien (cf. Republic, Theaetetus).

- Beauty here is a heavenly, recollective power that disciplines sensuality; the second speech is an allegory about a general love (not sex-specific), subordinating the sensual. Read alongside Laws VIII; avoid importing prurient readings. Two loves persist: lower animal desire vs higher, awe-filled contemplation of Forms.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Interpreting eros: Plato’s two loves persist—lower (animal) vs higher (philosophical, awe before Justice/Temperance/Holiness). He allows no indulgence of “unnatural” lusts. Humans yearn to see Ideas in visible beauty, but artworks and images are only shadows; even the finest Greek art is not a vision of the Forms.

- Pivot to rhetoric’s critique: Rhetoric aims to persuade without truth and blurs certain with probable. Of the three speeches: the first lacks definition and order; the second is better arranged; the third, though fanciful, uniquely rests on dialectical principles. Handbooks confuse preliminaries with creative power; genuine persuasion requires philosophy and psychological insight (from dialectic), not technique alone.

- Contemporary applications: Culture drifts from creation to criticism; cliques prize style over substance; art mistakes technique for art. Law makes the worse cause seem better and lacks systematic order; politics follows the many’s will, not truth; medicine becomes routine, ignoring holistic understanding; journalism and theology prefer popular acclaim to rigorous truth.

- Dialectic and writing: Dialectic is dividing/unifying, the soul’s inner dialogue. Plato’s “speech over writing” paradox highlights true writing as inscribed in the soul; writing preserves, living speech educates and transforms.

- Dating caution: References to Lysias/Isocrates don’t date the dialogue; Plato freely reassigns names and traits, so historical cues are unreliable.
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Dating the Phaedrus: Arguments from the depicted ages/status of Lysias and Isocrates, or from the Egyptian myth, are unreliable. Plato freely repurposes names and history; such cues cannot date the work. Internal features point to a later composition: mature style and insight; doctrines like soul-division, transmigration, the mind as primum mobile, and impulse within the immortal soul (cf. Timaeus, Sophist, Laws). The Socrates portrayed is largely Platonic, making an early, life-time composition unlikely. Given its close kinship with Symposium, Phaedrus is best placed near the Republic—after Plato leaves the purely Socratic vantage but before the more abstract period (Sophist/Philebus).

- Two notable side-passages:
  - Mythology: Plato rejects allegorical/Euhemerist readings as attractive but untestable and distracting from self-knowledge; myths can poetically convey feeling, not establish truth (cf. Republic 378e). Ironical touches (Typho, “common opinion is enough,” “poor diviner”) mark the stance.
  - Grasshoppers: Scene-anchoring fable likening Athenians to “grasshoppers” reporting to the Muses; signals a topic shift and preserves the setting.

- Mysticism: To grasp Phaedrus/Symposium one must appreciate a rationally infused mysticism—love of the good/one, sense of infinite knowledge—which “renews the soul’s wings.”

- Satire of rhetoric and cultural decline: Phaedrus targets fourth‑century rhetorical “professors” and their sham art—rule-heavy, truth-light, ignorant of soul-psychology—contrasted with ancient genius (Homer, tragic poets). Plato anticipates a long Greek literary stagnation (from Isocratean platitudes and Alexandrians onward), marked by lack of method in science, criticism in history, simplicity in poetry, political freedom in oratory, and by decadent, eclectic, ascetic/mystical philosophy. The deeper deficit is moral and aspirational—no love of knowledge, no great characters, confusion of words and things—yielding centuries of derivative writing and loss of much classical greatness.
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Editorial bridge on decline and renewal: The later Greek world lacked the moral-psychic roots of literary excellence—no aspiration, civic energy, consistency, or love of knowledge—so it retreated to authority and tradition, lost true poetry (and thus good prose), confused words with things, and misread or neglected the classics. Literature devolved into compilations, scholia, forgeries, and pedantry fixated on minutiae, hastening the loss of major works. A similar decay could recur, harming national manners. Possible remedies: broaden and improve education (better teacher training, higher standards, cheap press), cultivate latent talent at scale, leverage cooperative intelligence, extend education across generations, intensify global exchange (East/West), increase leisure for mind’s improvement, deepen awe before nature, replace narrow nationalism with philanthropy, reduce prejudice/party spirit, and carry forward the past’s seeds of revival. Thus literature need not die.

- Dialogue begins: Socrates meets Phaedrus, who brings Lysias’ written argument that a non‑lover is preferable to a lover. Socrates jokes, assumes Phaedrus memorized it, and, spotting the roll, insists on hearing the text. They seek shade by the Ilissus, discuss the Boreas–Oreithyia tale; Socrates offers a rationalizing account but dismisses such myth “explanations” as time-wasting, prioritizing the Delphic maxim to know oneself.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Socrates offers a “rational” account of the Boreas–Oreithyia myth, then rejects myth-allegorizing as a time‑wasting “crude philosophy.” He prioritizes the Delphic command to know oneself, wondering whether he is a Typho-like monster or a gentler nature. They settle by a sacred, breezy plane tree; Socrates quips he learns from people, not trees, and can be lured anywhere by a book.

- Phaedrus reads Lysias’ speech arguing the non‑lover is preferable:
  - Non‑lovers don’t repent favors, act without compulsion, and better balance present pleasure with future benefit; lovers, being irrational, later regret, shift affections, and harm the beloved.
  - More non‑lovers means a better pool; lovers boast and expose affairs to public shame.
  - Lovers are jealous/possessive, isolating the beloved from wealthier or wiser friends; non‑lovers encourage beneficial associations.
  - Lovers often love the body before knowing character, so affection fades; non‑lovers’ preexisting friendship is strengthened by favors.
  - Lovers’ praise is distorted by passion, spoiling the beloved; non‑lovers are self‑controlled, slow to anger, forgiving of inadvertent faults.
  - One should favor those able to reciprocate, modest and lifelong friends, not the neediest or noisiest suitors; do not indulge every non‑lover either. Love should benefit both, injure neither.

- Afterward, Socrates ironically praises the style but critiques Lysias’ repetitious rhetoric (saying the same thing in varied ways). Claiming “inspiration,” he says he could deliver an equally good but different speech, as if filled from forgotten sources (Sappho, Anacreon, or a prose writer).
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Debate on Lysias: Phaedrus praises Lysias’ exhaustive “repetition”; Socrates insists such commonplaces are unavoidable and merit lies in arrangement, not invention. Pressed by oath, he agrees to deliver a better, different speech, adopting the non‑lover’s thesis.

- Methodical start: Good counsel requires definition. Love is defined as an irrational desire for personal beauty that overcomes reason; in each of us, desire for pleasure contends with opinion guided by reason toward the best—temperance when reason rules, excess when desire rules. Non‑lovers also desire the beautiful/good, but are not ruled by mania.

- Harms caused by the lover:
  - Intellectual/moral: The lover, fearing equality or superiority in the beloved, seeks to keep him inferior—ignorant, timid, inarticulate—jealously cutting him off from associations that would improve him, above all from philosophy.
  - Physical: He fosters delicacy and luxury, avoiding training and toil, producing weakness in crisis.
  - Social/economic: He alienates the beloved from family, friends, and wealth (which lessen his control), preferring him poor, isolated, and dependent.
  - Companionship: Mismatched in years, the lover imposes constant, intrusive presence driven by desire; the beloved endures surveillance, cloying praise, misplaced reproaches, and the lover’s unattractive aging—made worse by indiscretions when drunk.

This sets the non‑lover as the safer, more beneficial choice and models Socrates’ insistence on definition and psychological analysis before rhetoric.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Completing the anti‑lover case: Socrates adds practical harms of taking a lover—mismatch of ages breeds constraint; the lover’s incessant presence, jealous surveillance, and cloying praises/censures disgust the beloved, with indiscretions amplified in drink. When passion wanes, the lover breaks oaths, evades repayment of favors, and turns hostile. Thus the beloved wrongly exchanges a “demented” lover for a sensible non‑lover, to the detriment of estate, health, and, above all, the mind.

- Socrates closes the first speech, saying the non‑lover has the opposite advantages, and tries to leave. Phaedrus detains him.

- A divine sign (daimonion) checks Socrates: he has been impious by reviling Eros, a god. Citing Stesichorus’ recantation for slandering Helen, he vows a palinode and even urges Lysias to write in praise of the lover.

- Palinode thesis: not all “madness” is bad; some is divinely sent and supremely beneficial—(1) prophetic inspiration (Delphi, Dodona, Sibyl), supported by etymological play linking mantikē with manikē; (2) purificatory, curing ancestral guilt via inspired rites; (3) Muses’ possession, the source of true poetry that eclipses mere art.

- Challenge: prefer the inspired lover unless one can show love is not a divine good.

- Turn to psychology to ground the praise: the soul is immortal because it is self‑moving—the unbegotten, indestructible first source of motion; if the self‑moving perished, all motion and becoming would cease. This initiates the argument for divine eros.
</CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>
- Socrates begins his proof by arguing the soul is immortal: the self-moving is the source of all motion; as unbegotten and indestructible “beginning,” it cannot perish. Soul is essentially self-moving; bodies moved from without are soulless.

- Allegory: the soul is a charioteer with two winged horses (one noble, one base). Wings—akin to the divine—are nourished by beauty, wisdom, goodness; vice wastes them. Perfect, fully winged souls soar and order the cosmos; imperfect souls lose wings, descend, and animate bodies.

- Celestial procession: Zeus leads the gods up “beyond heaven” where true being (colorless, formless, intelligible) is seen—justice, temperance, knowledge absolute. Gods feed on this truth; other souls strive to keep up. The best nearly behold reality; most struggle, are damaged, fail to see, and feed on opinion.

- Destiny’s law: souls that glimpse truth are preserved till the next cycle; failing souls fall, first incarnate as humans. Rank of prior vision fixes human type: 1) philosopher/artist/musical lover; 2) righteous king/warrior; 3) politician/economist/trader; 4) athlete/physician; 5) prophet/hierophant; 6) poet/imitator; 7) artisan/farmer; 8) sophist/demagogue; 9) tyrant. Justice improves, injustice worsens.

- Cycles: generally 10,000 years to regrow wings; philosophers or philosophic lovers may in 3,000; ordinary good also after thrice choosing. After the first life, souls are judged, rewarded/punished, then choose new lives; animal–human transmigration occurs. Only souls that have seen truth can be human; recollection is grasping the one from many.

- Erotic “madness” is the highest inspiration: earthly beauty uniquely evokes recollection. The corrupt plunge into lust; the newly initiated feel awe, reverence, and a physical stirring—moistening wings, heat, perspiration—igniting the lover’s divinely inspired frenzy.
</CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>
- Two responses to beauty: the uninitiated fixate on bodily “namesakes” and pursue lawless pleasure; the newly initiated, recalling true Beauty, feel awe, trembling, heat, and “wing‑growth” pains as beauty’s effluence enters through the eyes, alternately tormenting and soothing them. This frenzy explains the lover’s single‑minded devotion and neglect of worldly norms.

- God‑typed eros: Lovers model themselves on the god they once followed and seek beloveds suited to that god (Zeus → philosophical/kingly natures; Hera → royal; Apollo, etc.). They revere, educate, and reshape the beloved to that likeness without jealousy, pouring divine “inspiration” into him.

- Charioteer struggle specified: The noble horse is white, honor‑loving, responsive to reason; the base horse is dark, insolent, needing force. Before the beloved, the base horse drags the soul toward unlawful acts; repeated resistance culminates in the charioteer bloodying and subduing it. Thereafter the lover follows in modesty and sacred fear.

- How love becomes mutual: The beloved, moved by the lover’s faithful service, admits him to intimacy. Beauty reflects back through the “windows” of the soul, watering the beloved’s wings; he catches “love for love” (Anteros), though he mistakes it for mere friendship, and longs similarly.

- Fork of outcomes: If reason and philosophy rule, the pair live orderly, master passions, and become light and “winged,” winning a heavenly victory. If they abandon philosophy, they may, in careless moments, consummate the desire; they then continue but rarely, lacking the whole soul’s approval.
</CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>
- Outcome of eros depends on self-control: when together, the beloved cannot easily refuse; if reason and philosophy prevail, the pair live orderly, master passions, “enslave” vicious and “free” virtuous elements, and at death depart “light and winged,” winning one of the three Olympian victories—the highest human blessing. If they abandon philosophy for ambition, they likely consummate in careless moments; their bond persists but is lesser, lacking whole‑soul approval. After death they are unwinged yet dwell in light, avoid under‑earth punishments, and eventually regrow matching wings together.

- Contrast with non‑lover: the prudent, stingy attachment of a non‑lover breeds vulgarity applauded by the many, sends the soul wandering the earth for 9,000 years, and leaves it foolish below. Socrates prays to Eros to accept his recantation, blames Lysias for earlier impieties, and urges him to study philosophy (like Polemarchus).

- Transition to writing and rhetoric: Against Phaedrus’ worry that “speech‑writing” is disreputable, Socrates argues statesmen love authorship—laws are writings with their names; writing isn’t shameful, only bad writing is.

- On true rhetoric: Good speaking must know truth, though truth alone doesn’t ensure persuasion. Deceitful rhetoric that confounds good and evil harms cities. Socrates invites a “Spartan” challenge: no real art of speech exists apart from truth; only philosophy equips one to speak rightly. Rhetoric is a general mind‑enchanting power across contexts, adept at making the same thing seem just/unjust or good/bad (cf. Zeno’s paradoxes); its method hinges on exploiting likenesses, with deception easiest where differences are smallest.
</CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>
- Scope of rhetoric: Socrates broadens rhetoric to a general art of mind‑enchantment across all contexts, grounded in manipulating likenesses. Deception works best where differences are small and by gradual shifts; thus a true rhetor must know real natures and the precise likenesses/differences among things. Without truth, one has a ridiculous pseudo‑rhetoric.

- Domain selection and classification: Since rhetoric is strongest in “debatable” matters (e.g., justice, goodness) rather than agreed ones (e.g., iron, silver), the orator must:
  - Divide subjects into agreed vs disputed domains.
  - Classify particulars correctly under these domains.
  - Define key terms (e.g., love) before arguing.

- Critique of Lysias (form): Lysias begins at the end, lacks ordered progression and organic unity (a speech should be a living whole with beginning, middle, end). His composition is as reorderable as the Midas epitaph—showing no governing principle.

- Method from Socrates’ palinode (form/content): Extracts two dialectical canons for true rhetoric:
  1) Collection: gather scattered particulars under one idea via definition to secure clarity/consistency.
  2) Division “at the joints”: split a genus into its natural species without mutilation (e.g., separate “left‑handed” vicious love from “right‑handed” divine love).

- Dialectic vs handbook rhetoric: Socrates calls those who can see the One and the Many “dialecticians” and contrasts them with handbook teachers. He inventories technical precepts—exordium, facts, witnesses, proofs, probabilities, confirmations/refutations (Theodorus), insinuations/indirect praise/blame (Evenus), “probability over truth,” making small seem great (Tisias, Gorgias), proper length (Prodicus), stylistic treasuries (Polus), correct diction and pathos management (Protagoras)—implying these are secondary without dialectical knowledge of truth and soul.
</CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 15 SUMMARY>
- Completing the handbook survey: Sophistic manuals teach how to make the small seem great, the old seem new, vary length “conveniently” (Prodicus), stock up on stylistic devices (Hippias, Polus’ “treasuries,” Protagoras’ diction and pathos), and end with recapitulations. These are mere preliminaries.

- Critique by analogies: Knowing drug types without knowing “to whom, when, and how much” doesn’t make a physician; likewise, knowing to make speeches long/short or “pathetic/terrible” doesn’t make a tragedian; knowing extreme notes doesn’t make a harmonist. True art is arranging parts suitably into a whole. Thus current rhetoric misses the art, mistaking instruments for composition.

- Model of a true orator: Pericles exemplifies rhetoric perfected by nature plus philosophical understanding, gained from Anaxagoras’ “Mind” speculations. Great arts require high inquiry into nature.

- Rhetoric as a science of the soul: Like medicine defines the body, rhetoric must define the soul to “implant” conviction/virtue. Method: determine whether the soul is simple or multiform; enumerate its forms; analyze how it acts/is acted on; classify soul-types and speech-types; match and justify which arguments persuade which souls and why. Mastery also requires experiential recognition and timing (when to speak, refrain, or use pathos, maxims, etc.).

- Rebuttal from “the wolf” (sophistic view): In law and public persuasion, truth is irrelevant; only conviction matters, grounded in probability. Facts that are “improbable” should be suppressed; always speak to what seems likely to the many. Tisias defines probability as what the many think.
</CHUNK 15 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 16 SUMMARY>
- Sophistic “wolf” position restated: in courts and public life, truth is irrelevant; conviction rests on probability (what the many think). Tisias’ paradigm shows crafting “likelihood” even by lying (e.g., weak vs strong assailant), suppressing improbable facts.

- Socrates’ rebuttal: probability is likeness to truth; only one who knows truth best discerns and deploys likenesses. True rhetoric requires:
  - Knowing the truth of particulars.
  - Defining unities and dividing “at the joints” to irreducibles.
  - Knowing soul-types and matching simple/complex discourses appropriately.
  Aim should be to please the gods (masters), not the many (fellow-servants); take the long road for great ends.

- Turn to writing: The Egyptian Theuth–Thamus myth critiques writing as producing forgetfulness and a semblance of wisdom. Writing, like painting, cannot answer questions, chooses its audience poorly, and lacks a defender.

- Living speech vs written text: the “lawfully begotten” word is knowledge inscribed in a soul, self-defending and timely. Adonis‑garden metaphor: serious sowing (education) is in fitting souls over time; writing is play/memorial (“writing in water”), fit to refresh memory in old age.

- Final criteria and censure: Until one meets the above dialectical and psychological conditions, one cannot practice rhetoric as an art for teaching or persuading. Authors of laws/treatises who lack knowledge of justice/good confuse dream with reality and are disgraceful despite applause. The right man treats writing as reminder only; true clarity and seriousness lie in orally planting principles of justice, goodness, and nobility in souls—his legitimate offspring.
</CHUNK 16 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 17 SUMMARY>
- Final stance on writing and teaching: The “right man” treats written works as secondary reminders; true clarity and seriousness lie in orally teaching and engraving principles of justice, goodness, and nobility into souls. Such living knowledge is his genuine “offspring”: first, the true word discovered within himself; second, its kin implanted in others’ souls. Mere recital for belief without examination or instruction is of little value.

- Message to authors and lawmakers: Tell Lysias, poets (including Homer), and lawgivers (e.g., Solon) that only if their writings rest on knowledge of truth and they can defend and surpass them in live dialectic should they be honored above “poet/orator/legislator” and called “philosophers” (lovers of wisdom; “wise” belongs to God alone). Those who cannot rise above their patched compositions remain mere speechmakers.

- Isocrates: Socrates prophesies that the young Isocrates surpasses Lysias in talent and character, will outgrow rhetoric, and be led by a divine philosophical impulse to higher things.

- Closing prayer and exit: Socrates prays to Pan for inward beauty, harmony of inner and outer, to count the wise as truly wealthy, and for only as much gold as a temperate man can bear. Phaedrus asks the same; they depart.
