- Socrates begins his proof by arguing the soul is immortal: the self-moving is the source of all motion; as unbegotten and indestructible “beginning,” it cannot perish. Soul is essentially self-moving; bodies moved from without are soulless.

- Allegory: the soul is a charioteer with two winged horses (one noble, one base). Wings—akin to the divine—are nourished by beauty, wisdom, goodness; vice wastes them. Perfect, fully winged souls soar and order the cosmos; imperfect souls lose wings, descend, and animate bodies.

- Celestial procession: Zeus leads the gods up “beyond heaven” where true being (colorless, formless, intelligible) is seen—justice, temperance, knowledge absolute. Gods feed on this truth; other souls strive to keep up. The best nearly behold reality; most struggle, are damaged, fail to see, and feed on opinion.

- Destiny’s law: souls that glimpse truth are preserved till the next cycle; failing souls fall, first incarnate as humans. Rank of prior vision fixes human type: 1) philosopher/artist/musical lover; 2) righteous king/warrior; 3) politician/economist/trader; 4) athlete/physician; 5) prophet/hierophant; 6) poet/imitator; 7) artisan/farmer; 8) sophist/demagogue; 9) tyrant. Justice improves, injustice worsens.

- Cycles: generally 10,000 years to regrow wings; philosophers or philosophic lovers may in 3,000; ordinary good also after thrice choosing. After the first life, souls are judged, rewarded/punished, then choose new lives; animal–human transmigration occurs. Only souls that have seen truth can be human; recollection is grasping the one from many.

- Erotic “madness” is the highest inspiration: earthly beauty uniquely evokes recollection. The corrupt plunge into lust; the newly initiated feel awe, reverence, and a physical stirring—moistening wings, heat, perspiration—igniting the lover’s divinely inspired frenzy.
