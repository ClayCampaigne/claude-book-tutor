- Divine eros in practice: The lover’s frenzy makes family, wealth, and convention negligible; only the beloved can relieve his wing-growth pains. Lovers’ characters mirror the god they once followed (Zeus → philosophical/royal natures; Ares → fierce, etc.) and they seek matching beloveds, imparting their godlike stamp. In the soul’s charioteer struggle, the base horse presses for gratification; the charioteer, awed by the beloved, restrains and finally bloodies the base horse into submission. With self‑mastery, both become modest and reverent, share the same image of love, and, if continent, attain the highest human happiness and “heavenly victory”; even the more ambitious pair fares well, though inferior. Persevering, they eventually “grow wings” together after death.

- Turn to rhetoric and writing: Socrates recants to honor Love, then critiques rhetoric. Good speaking begins from truth; rhetoric is an enchanting use of likenesses that still presupposes knowledge of truth to deceive or to resist deception. Using Lysias’ and his own speeches, Socrates contrasts disorder with dialectical method: define terms; collect into unities and divide into parts (synthesis/analysis). Handbooks (Polus, Tisias, Gorgias, etc.) mistake preliminaries for art; true rhetoric, like medicine, requires knowing soul‑types, occasions, and aims at pleasing the gods, not mere probability.

- Writing vs speech: The Theuth–Thamus myth grounds speech’s superiority—writing is image-like, fixed, unresponsive, a “bastard” of knowledge; sow in souls, not hotbeds. A good orator must know truth and adapt it to souls; living speech begets living understanding. Messages are sent to Lysias and Isocrates; a prayer closes.

- Unity/theme: Phaedrus interweaves five strands—false rhetoric, divine love, dialectic (collection/division), true rhetoric grounded in dialectic and psychology, and speech’s superiority—rhetoric being the continuous thread. Socrates’ second speech models the higher rhetoric; love aligns with dialectic, ascending from interested love (conventional rhetoric), to disinterested sensory love (poetry), to love of the unseen (dialectic).
