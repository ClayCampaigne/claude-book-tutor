- Socrates condemns both initial speeches as impious toward Love because they assume love is self-interested; he contrasts them with a divine, disinterested, enduring eros introduced via a myth that should be read as a parable, not pressed in detail.

- Core of the myth: the soul is self-moving and source of motion; then, allegorically, a charioteer (reason) with two horses—black (concupiscence) and white (honor-loving, akin to thumos)—presents an early tripartite psychology. Unlike Parmenides’ chariot, Plato’s is moral-allegorical.

- Preexistence and recollection: souls once followed gods, glimpsed Forms, and now strive to regain that vision; desire hinders, reason with the noble element allies against it. Ideal eros is continent; concessions to desire are second-best. Plato is serious about preexistence, recollection, reason’s primacy, and likely transmigration.

- “Madness” signals inspired faculties (genius/inspiration) beyond rule and also plays on common views of philosophy; some details (souls stamped by a god, playful etymologies) blend irony and allegory.

- Do not literalize cycles (10,000 years) or infer that tyrants can be righteous; weightier are: universals distinguish humans; rational “grace” tends to persevere.

- Proto-doctrinal hints: chance with freedom/responsibility; a moral principle in man (immortal steed); God’s essentially moral nature (contemplation of Justice/Virtue); life as aspiration beyond art; a nascent necessary/contingent distinction; soul as cosmic motive reason. The philosopher appears “mad” or alien (cf. Republic, Theaetetus).

- Beauty here is a heavenly, recollective power that disciplines sensuality; the second speech is an allegory about a general love (not sex-specific), subordinating the sensual. Read alongside Laws VIII; avoid importing prurient readings. Two loves persist: lower animal desire vs higher, awe-filled contemplation of Forms.
