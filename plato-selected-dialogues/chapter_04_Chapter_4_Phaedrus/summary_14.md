- Scope of rhetoric: Socrates broadens rhetoric to a general art of mind‑enchantment across all contexts, grounded in manipulating likenesses. Deception works best where differences are small and by gradual shifts; thus a true rhetor must know real natures and the precise likenesses/differences among things. Without truth, one has a ridiculous pseudo‑rhetoric.

- Domain selection and classification: Since rhetoric is strongest in “debatable” matters (e.g., justice, goodness) rather than agreed ones (e.g., iron, silver), the orator must:
  - Divide subjects into agreed vs disputed domains.
  - Classify particulars correctly under these domains.
  - Define key terms (e.g., love) before arguing.

- Critique of Lysias (form): Lysias begins at the end, lacks ordered progression and organic unity (a speech should be a living whole with beginning, middle, end). His composition is as reorderable as the Midas epitaph—showing no governing principle.

- Method from Socrates’ palinode (form/content): Extracts two dialectical canons for true rhetoric:
  1) Collection: gather scattered particulars under one idea via definition to secure clarity/consistency.
  2) Division “at the joints”: split a genus into its natural species without mutilation (e.g., separate “left‑handed” vicious love from “right‑handed” divine love).

- Dialectic vs handbook rhetoric: Socrates calls those who can see the One and the Many “dialecticians” and contrasts them with handbook teachers. He inventories technical precepts—exordium, facts, witnesses, proofs, probabilities, confirmations/refutations (Theodorus), insinuations/indirect praise/blame (Evenus), “probability over truth,” making small seem great (Tisias, Gorgias), proper length (Prodicus), stylistic treasuries (Polus), correct diction and pathos management (Protagoras)—implying these are secondary without dialectical knowledge of truth and soul.
