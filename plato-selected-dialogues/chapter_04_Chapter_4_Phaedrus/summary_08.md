- Socrates offers a “rational” account of the Boreas–Oreithyia myth, then rejects myth-allegorizing as a time‑wasting “crude philosophy.” He prioritizes the Delphic command to know oneself, wondering whether he is a Typho-like monster or a gentler nature. They settle by a sacred, breezy plane tree; Socrates quips he learns from people, not trees, and can be lured anywhere by a book.

- Phaedrus reads Lysias’ speech arguing the non‑lover is preferable:
  - Non‑lovers don’t repent favors, act without compulsion, and better balance present pleasure with future benefit; lovers, being irrational, later regret, shift affections, and harm the beloved.
  - More non‑lovers means a better pool; lovers boast and expose affairs to public shame.
  - Lovers are jealous/possessive, isolating the beloved from wealthier or wiser friends; non‑lovers encourage beneficial associations.
  - Lovers often love the body before knowing character, so affection fades; non‑lovers’ preexisting friendship is strengthened by favors.
  - Lovers’ praise is distorted by passion, spoiling the beloved; non‑lovers are self‑controlled, slow to anger, forgiving of inadvertent faults.
  - One should favor those able to reciprocate, modest and lifelong friends, not the neediest or noisiest suitors; do not indulge every non‑lover either. Love should benefit both, injure neither.

- Afterward, Socrates ironically praises the style but critiques Lysias’ repetitious rhetoric (saying the same thing in varied ways). Claiming “inspiration,” he says he could deliver an equally good but different speech, as if filled from forgotten sources (Sappho, Anacreon, or a prose writer).
