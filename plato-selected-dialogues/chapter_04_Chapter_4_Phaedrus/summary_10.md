- Completing the anti‑lover case: Socrates adds practical harms of taking a lover—mismatch of ages breeds constraint; the lover’s incessant presence, jealous surveillance, and cloying praises/censures disgust the beloved, with indiscretions amplified in drink. When passion wanes, the lover breaks oaths, evades repayment of favors, and turns hostile. Thus the beloved wrongly exchanges a “demented” lover for a sensible non‑lover, to the detriment of estate, health, and, above all, the mind.

- Socrates closes the first speech, saying the non‑lover has the opposite advantages, and tries to leave. Phaedrus detains him.

- A divine sign (daimonion) checks Socrates: he has been impious by reviling Eros, a god. Citing Stesichorus’ recantation for slandering Helen, he vows a palinode and even urges Lysias to write in praise of the lover.

- Palinode thesis: not all “madness” is bad; some is divinely sent and supremely beneficial—(1) prophetic inspiration (Delphi, Dodona, Sibyl), supported by etymological play linking mantikē with manikē; (2) purificatory, curing ancestral guilt via inspired rites; (3) Muses’ possession, the source of true poetry that eclipses mere art.

- Challenge: prefer the inspired lover unless one can show love is not a divine good.

- Turn to psychology to ground the praise: the soul is immortal because it is self‑moving—the unbegotten, indestructible first source of motion; if the self‑moving perished, all motion and becoming would cease. This initiates the argument for divine eros.
