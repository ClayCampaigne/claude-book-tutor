- Outcome of eros depends on self-control: when together, the beloved cannot easily refuse; if reason and philosophy prevail, the pair live orderly, master passions, “enslave” vicious and “free” virtuous elements, and at death depart “light and winged,” winning one of the three Olympian victories—the highest human blessing. If they abandon philosophy for ambition, they likely consummate in careless moments; their bond persists but is lesser, lacking whole‑soul approval. After death they are unwinged yet dwell in light, avoid under‑earth punishments, and eventually regrow matching wings together.

- Contrast with non‑lover: the prudent, stingy attachment of a non‑lover breeds vulgarity applauded by the many, sends the soul wandering the earth for 9,000 years, and leaves it foolish below. Socrates prays to Eros to accept his recantation, blames Lysias for earlier impieties, and urges him to study philosophy (like Polemarchus).

- Transition to writing and rhetoric: Against Phaedrus’ worry that “speech‑writing” is disreputable, Socrates argues statesmen love authorship—laws are writings with their names; writing isn’t shameful, only bad writing is.

- On true rhetoric: Good speaking must know truth, though truth alone doesn’t ensure persuasion. Deceitful rhetoric that confounds good and evil harms cities. Socrates invites a “Spartan” challenge: no real art of speech exists apart from truth; only philosophy equips one to speak rightly. Rhetoric is a general mind‑enchanting power across contexts, adept at making the same thing seem just/unjust or good/bad (cf. Zeno’s paradoxes); its method hinges on exploiting likenesses, with deception easiest where differences are smallest.
