- Dating the Phaedrus: Arguments from the depicted ages/status of Lysias and Isocrates, or from the Egyptian myth, are unreliable. Plato freely repurposes names and history; such cues cannot date the work. Internal features point to a later composition: mature style and insight; doctrines like soul-division, transmigration, the mind as primum mobile, and impulse within the immortal soul (cf. Timaeus, Sophist, Laws). The Socrates portrayed is largely Platonic, making an early, life-time composition unlikely. Given its close kinship with Symposium, Phaedrus is best placed near the Republic—after Plato leaves the purely Socratic vantage but before the more abstract period (Sophist/Philebus).

- Two notable side-passages:
  - Mythology: Plato rejects allegorical/Euhemerist readings as attractive but untestable and distracting from self-knowledge; myths can poetically convey feeling, not establish truth (cf. Republic 378e). Ironical touches (Typho, “common opinion is enough,” “poor diviner”) mark the stance.
  - Grasshoppers: Scene-anchoring fable likening Athenians to “grasshoppers” reporting to the Muses; signals a topic shift and preserves the setting.

- Mysticism: To grasp Phaedrus/Symposium one must appreciate a rationally infused mysticism—love of the good/one, sense of infinite knowledge—which “renews the soul’s wings.”

- Satire of rhetoric and cultural decline: Phaedrus targets fourth‑century rhetorical “professors” and their sham art—rule-heavy, truth-light, ignorant of soul-psychology—contrasted with ancient genius (Homer, tragic poets). Plato anticipates a long Greek literary stagnation (from Isocratean platitudes and Alexandrians onward), marked by lack of method in science, criticism in history, simplicity in poetry, political freedom in oratory, and by decadent, eclectic, ascetic/mystical philosophy. The deeper deficit is moral and aspirational—no love of knowledge, no great characters, confusion of words and things—yielding centuries of derivative writing and loss of much classical greatness.
