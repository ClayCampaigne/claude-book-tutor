- Sophistic “wolf” position restated: in courts and public life, truth is irrelevant; conviction rests on probability (what the many think). Tisias’ paradigm shows crafting “likelihood” even by lying (e.g., weak vs strong assailant), suppressing improbable facts.

- Socrates’ rebuttal: probability is likeness to truth; only one who knows truth best discerns and deploys likenesses. True rhetoric requires:
  - Knowing the truth of particulars.
  - Defining unities and dividing “at the joints” to irreducibles.
  - Knowing soul-types and matching simple/complex discourses appropriately.
  Aim should be to please the gods (masters), not the many (fellow-servants); take the long road for great ends.

- Turn to writing: The Egyptian Theuth–Thamus myth critiques writing as producing forgetfulness and a semblance of wisdom. Writing, like painting, cannot answer questions, chooses its audience poorly, and lacks a defender.

- Living speech vs written text: the “lawfully begotten” word is knowledge inscribed in a soul, self-defending and timely. Adonis‑garden metaphor: serious sowing (education) is in fitting souls over time; writing is play/memorial (“writing in water”), fit to refresh memory in old age.

- Final criteria and censure: Until one meets the above dialectical and psychological conditions, one cannot practice rhetoric as an art for teaching or persuading. Authors of laws/treatises who lack knowledge of justice/good confuse dream with reality and are disgraceful despite applause. The right man treats writing as reminder only; true clarity and seriousness lie in orally planting principles of justice, goodness, and nobility in souls—his legitimate offspring.
