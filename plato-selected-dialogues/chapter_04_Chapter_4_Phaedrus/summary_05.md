- Interpreting eros: Plato’s two loves persist—lower (animal) vs higher (philosophical, awe before Justice/Temperance/Holiness). He allows no indulgence of “unnatural” lusts. Humans yearn to see Ideas in visible beauty, but artworks and images are only shadows; even the finest Greek art is not a vision of the Forms.

- Pivot to rhetoric’s critique: Rhetoric aims to persuade without truth and blurs certain with probable. Of the three speeches: the first lacks definition and order; the second is better arranged; the third, though fanciful, uniquely rests on dialectical principles. Handbooks confuse preliminaries with creative power; genuine persuasion requires philosophy and psychological insight (from dialectic), not technique alone.

- Contemporary applications: Culture drifts from creation to criticism; cliques prize style over substance; art mistakes technique for art. Law makes the worse cause seem better and lacks systematic order; politics follows the many’s will, not truth; medicine becomes routine, ignoring holistic understanding; journalism and theology prefer popular acclaim to rigorous truth.

- Dialectic and writing: Dialectic is dividing/unifying, the soul’s inner dialogue. Plato’s “speech over writing” paradox highlights true writing as inscribed in the soul; writing preserves, living speech educates and transforms.

- Dating caution: References to Lysias/Isocrates don’t date the dialogue; Plato freely reassigns names and traits, so historical cues are unreliable.
