- Gorgias defends rhetoric and its teachers: like boxing, the art itself is good; only misuse warrants blame and punishment, not the instructor. Rhetoric can persuade any crowd on any topic but ought to be used “fairly.”

- Socrates cautions that disputes often sour, then asks whether Gorgias will accept refutation for truth’s sake. The audience urges continuation; Gorgias agrees.

- Socrates secures key admissions: rhetoric persuades the ignorant more than experts; the rhetorician need not know truths but can seem to know them to the many.

- On justice, Socrates forces a fork: either pupils already know just/unjust, or Gorgias must teach it. Gorgias accepts he teaches it. Socrates infers: whoever learns justice is just, always wants and does the just; hence a trained rhetorician would never commit injustice—contradicting Gorgias’s earlier allowance that rhetors might use rhetoric unjustly while the teacher remains blameless.

- Polus protests that Socrates engineered a contradiction by shaming; Socrates insists on brief, reciprocal Q&A.

- Polus asks “What is rhetoric?” Socrates: it is not a techne but an empeiria—an experience producing pleasure/gratification—setting up the cookery analogy (“not an art”), and the forthcoming schema of true arts vs flattering knacks.
