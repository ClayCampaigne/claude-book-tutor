- Socrates elevates sophistry over courtroom rhetoric: as legislation surpasses litigation and gymnastic surpasses medicine, sophistry (framing norms) is higher than rhetoric (pleading cases). Orators and sophists refute themselves if they complain of being wronged by those they “taught,” since true improvers would produce just pupils. A trainer might be defrauded due to the pupil’s injustice; but one who truly removes injustice “cannot be treated unjustly” and could safely leave payment to the benefited. Hence it is honorable to take fees for technical advice (building, etc.), but dishonorable to sell counsel on how to live and govern best—such benefits alone rightly elicit voluntary requital.

- Pressed to choose, Callicles invites Socrates to be a state “servant/flatterer.” Socrates rejects threats, claiming he alone practises true politics—aiming at what is best, not most pleasant—and will be defenseless in court like a physician judged by children at a cook’s indictment. The only real defense is never doing wrong; fear injustice, not death.

- Eschatological myth: Zeus reforms judgment so naked souls are tried after death by naked, dead judges—Rhadamanthus (Asia), Aeacus (Europe), with Minos presiding—at a meadow where roads part to the Islands of the Blessed or to Tartarus. Souls carry visible moral “scars”; powerful men (tyrants, kings) often appear deformed by luxury and lawlessness and are dispatched to punishment. Punishment has two aims: to improve curable sinners through suffering, and to display incurables in perpetual torment as warnings; Archelaus typifies the latter if Polus’s account is true.
