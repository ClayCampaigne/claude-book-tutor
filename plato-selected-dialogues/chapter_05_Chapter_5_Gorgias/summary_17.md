- Socrates seals the prior argument by shifting from “painfulness” to “harmfulness”: if vice (evil of the soul) is most disgraceful yet not more painful than bodily or external ills, its excess of disgrace must come from its greater harmfulness; thus injustice/intemperance are the greatest evils.

- Corresponding “arts” cure each domain: moneymaking cures poverty; medicine cures disease; justice (through judges’ rightful punishment) cures vice. Justice is “medicine” for the soul.

- Ranking of conditions:
  - Best: never to have vice.
  - Second-best: to be punished/admonished and thereby cured.
  - Worst: to commit great crimes and escape correction (e.g., Archelaus, tyrants, flattering rhetors).
  - Analogy: evading punishment = a patient refusing painful surgery; such people use money, friends, and persuasion to avoid the cure.

- Practical upshot on rhetoric:
  - For the just life, rhetoric is useful only to accuse oneself and one’s associates so they receive due penalties and are healed; accept scourging, bonds, fines, exile, even death.
  - If one aims to harm enemies, rhetoric’s “use” is to help them evade punishment and persist in wickedness.

- Callicles intervenes, calling Socrates’ conclusions world-inverting. Socrates replies that he merely echoes philosophy—constant unlike Alcibiades/Demos—and challenges Callicles to refute the claim that doing injustice unpunished is worst, else live in inner discord.

- Callicles’ counter-thesis (physis vs nomos): Socrates traps interlocutors by toggling between convention and nature. By nature, suffering injustice is worse (hence more disgraceful) and is slavish; “justice” as equality is a convention made by the weak majority to restrain the naturally stronger/better from having more (pleonexia).
