- Socrates applies a competence test: as with builders or state-physicians, one shouldn’t “begin with the big jar” (attempt public works or public cure) without private proofs of success. He challenges Callicles, now a public aspirant, to name anyone—citizen or slave—whom he has made better (less unjust, intemperate, or foolish). Callicles won’t answer.

- Reaffirming the statesman’s true aim—improving citizens—Socrates re-examines Pericles, Cimon, Miltiades, and Themistocles. If they were good, Athenians should have become gentler and more just. Instead, the people turned savagely on them (fines, ostracism, exile, near-death), like poorly managed animals becoming fiercer. Thus they did not truly improve the city; at best they were superior “servants” who gratified popular desires and built docks, walls, and fleets.

- Recasting his body/soul schema: purveyors (bakers, cooks, weavers, shoemakers) minister cravings, whereas the true ruling arts—gymnastic and medicine for the body—should govern them. Analogously for the soul, genuine political care (law/justice) must rule over rhetoric/supply. Callicles’ heroes are like indulgent caterers who fatten patients, leaving a long-run “disease” (an ulcerated city lacking justice/temperance). When crisis comes, the crowd blames current advisers, while the earlier flatterers were the real authors; Callicles and Alcibiades risk becoming targets.

- Strong claim: “No statesman is unjustly put to death by his own city.” Like sophists who say they teach virtue yet complain pupils wrong them, orators betray by such complaints that they failed to make citizens just. Socrates equates rhetors and sophists (calling sophistry “superior” to rhetoric as legislation is to litigation, gymnastic to medicine), and argues that true improvers could trust payment to the benefited; people act unjustly from vice, not from lack of speed or skill.
