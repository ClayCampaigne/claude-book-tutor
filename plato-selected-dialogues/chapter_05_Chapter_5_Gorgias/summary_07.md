- Jowett notes Plato’s mythic “fiction” forces a quasi-corporeal postmortem soul and invokes Homer (Minos with a golden scepter) to lend plausibility. He cautions against reading the dialogue as history or as Plato’s literal voice; Plato plays “both sides,” is poet-dramatist as well as philosopher.

- “Right of dissent”: Plato isn’t asserting modern free-thought; rather, the duty/right of the one wise person to oppose the many’s folly, accepting Socrates’ likely fate. His irony shields and reveals high idealism; he appears paradoxical yet appeals to higher reason.

- Four main theses distilled:
  1) Doing injustice is worse than suffering it: moral evil alone is truly evil; tyrants remain miserable despite success; principles must not sink to practice; the real harm is present degradation of the soul.
  2) It is better to be punished than to escape: hidden consequences educate character; unpunished wrong is greatest misfortune; paradoxical “retaliation” is to let enemies go unpunished; use rhetoric inwardly for self-accusation to correct oneself.
  3) We do what we “wish,” not what we truly will: uninformed good intentions backfire; hence “virtue is knowledge” as a needed half-truth linking right and consequences.
  4) To be, not to seem: praise-seeking breeds conscious/unconscious hypocrisy; entrenched “sophistries” of professions, parties, and institutions outstrip ancient sophists in deceiving.
