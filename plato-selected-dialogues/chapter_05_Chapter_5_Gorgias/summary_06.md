- Jowett underscores Plato’s ethical idealism: true happiness lies in truth and right, not in pleasure, fame, or utility; we admire sufferers for justice even when pain isn’t offset by felt satisfaction. Plato is not merely self-regarding; in antiquity care for others is embedded in politics, and Socrates stresses sharing truth.

- To “justify the ways of God,” Plato supplements the present world’s injustice with postmortem recompense: few tyrants are incurable examples; most are corrigible, and punishment is meant to heal. Jowett notes the limits of Plato’s analogies (disease/medicine for injustice/justice), the conflation of images with realities, and the lack of a worked-out mechanism for moral growth via punishment, though the Republic hints at educative development beyond death.

- Main aim of Gorgias: oppose true vs false life and human opinions vs true judgment, using a superhuman ideal that nonetheless shapes aspiration and critiques real politics.

- Subordinate themes:
  a) Good vs pleasure: Plato ties good to permanence/objectivity and pleasure to flux; Jowett flags the asymmetry and subjectivity issues.
  b) “Flatteries”: arts severed from truth/improvement (rhetoric, sophistry, much poetry) cater to opinion; the lone wise person prizes virtue.
  c) Links to Republic, Philebus, Protagoras: shared critiques of poets/rhetors; different treatments of pleasure; common motifs of measure, order, and persuasion.
  d) Minor notes: Socratic ironies (pilot’s fee; rhetoric as self-accusation; “geometrical equality”); myth echoes dialogue themes (naked souls/judges; exemplary tyrants); Homeric embellishment.

- Methodological cautions: Plato is dramatic and poetic; speakers needn’t voice his settled views; avoid judging historical figures from the dialogue.
