- Socrates sharpens the “power” argument by distinguishing ends from means: agents will the good (end) for which they act, not the intermediate acts (often indifferent: walking, sailing; or even killing, exile, confiscation). If a tyrant/rhetor does what seems best but it is not truly good, he does not do what he wills; hence he lacks “great power” (which must benefit its possessor).

- Against Polus’s envy of those who can “do as they please” justly or unjustly, Socrates replies: unjust doers are to be pitied, not envied; doing injustice is worse than suffering it, and he would choose suffering over doing wrong.

- Dagger analogy: the mere capacity to harm at will isn’t real power because it predictably brings punishment, which Polus concedes is an evil. True power is action that turns to one’s advantage; acts like killing/exiling/confiscating are good only when just, evil when unjust.

- Polus cites Archelaus of Macedon as an unjust yet happy ruler, narrating his murders. Socrates rejects “witness”-style refutation by reputation or numbers; truth requires dialectic and persuading the single interlocutor. He maintains happiness hinges on justice/education: the good are happy; the unjust miserable.

- Positions crystallize: Polus—unjust unpunished are happy, punished are miserable; Socrates—the unjust are miserable regardless, more so if unpunished, less so if punished (anticipating punishment as a benefit to the soul).
