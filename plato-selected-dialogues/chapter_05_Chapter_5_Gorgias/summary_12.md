- Socrates sharpens the inquiry: many arts “use words,” so each must be defined by “words about what.” He presses Gorgias to specify rhetoric’s subject and the kind of persuasion it produces.

- Gorgias stakes rhetoric’s value as the greatest human good: it grants freedom and rule by persuading assemblies, councils, and courts. Rhetoric is “the artificer of persuasion,” making even physicians, trainers, and moneymakers “slaves” to the skilled speaker.

- Socrates introduces a key distinction: learning/knowledge vs belief. Since belief can be false but knowledge cannot, there are two kinds of persuasion—one producing knowledge, the other mere belief. Gorgias concedes rhetoric yields belief (without teaching) about the just and unjust, especially because large audiences cannot be instructed in a short time.

- Socrates notes technical choices (physicians, shipwrights, generals; building walls, docks) properly belong to experts. Gorgias replies that in practice rhetoricians prevail in such civic decisions, citing Themistocles and Pericles (e.g., the “middle wall”). He boasts rhetoric can out‑persuade experts on any subject and offers an anecdote of swaying a patient where a doctor failed; a rhetor could even win election as state‑physician.

- Ethical caveat: like boxing, the art isn’t blameworthy if misused; responsibility lies with the user. Rhetoric’s power should be exercised “fairly,” not to defraud genuine experts.
