- Callicles rejects the “full, sound casks” life as stone-like; happiness is continual inflow—unceasing desire and gratification (eating, drinking, etc.). Socrates pushes a reductio with “itching and scratching” and shameful sexual cases to test whether any pleasure counts as happiness. Callicles initially bites the bullet (even the scratcher lives pleasantly, hence happily) and, for consistency, asserts pleasure = good.

- Socrates then mounts a formal refutation:
  - Callicles grants knowledge and courage are distinct from pleasure; and that good and evil fortune are contraries that exclude co-presence (like health/disease).
  - He also grants desires are painful, while satisfying them is pleasant; thus, in cases like drinking while thirsty, pain and pleasure occur simultaneously and cease together.
  - Since good and evil cannot be present (or cease) together, while pleasure and pain can, the good cannot be identical with the pleasant.

- A second line: both fools/cowards and wise/brave feel pleasures and pains, with cowards often feeling more pleasure; if pleasure = good, the worse could be “better,” which is absurd.

- Pressed, Callicles retreats: not all pleasures are good; some are bad. He accepts the criterion Socrates wanted: beneficial pleasures are good; hurtful ones are evil—opening the way to evaluate pleasures by their effects on the soul.
