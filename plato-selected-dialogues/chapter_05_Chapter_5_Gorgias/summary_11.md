- Jowett’s bridge from myth to method: Plato’s “Cronos” tale hints at possibilities—a state of innocence, a world without traditions, and contrast between divine vs human government—while extending his thought-experiments about abolishing family and property (as in the ideal state). He praises Plato’s language for uniting poetry/prose and speech/writing, moving fluidly between visible and unseen, using vivid, conversational myths and “broken” metaphors that work by overall effect rather than strict consistency.

- Gorgias scene setup: At Callicles’ house, Socrates arrives late; Chaerephon secures a Q&A “exhibition.” Gorgias agrees to answer briefly; Polus tries to respond but displays rhetoric over dialectic, prompting Socrates to question Gorgias directly.

- Definitional elenchus begins:
  - Gorgias identifies his art as rhetoric and claims to make others rhetoricians.
  - To “what is rhetoric concerned with?” Gorgias answers: discourse. Socrates shows many arts use discourse (medicine, gymnastic; arithmetic, calculation, geometry, astronomy).
  - Gorgias narrows: rhetoric “works only through discourse,” not manual action. Socrates notes this still fits arts like arithmetic/geometry, so subject-matter must be specified.
  - Using analogies (arithmetic: odd/even; calculation: numerical relations; astronomy: celestial motions), Socrates presses “words about what?” Gorgias replies: “the greatest and best of human things,” which Socrates flags as ambiguous, inviting further precision.
