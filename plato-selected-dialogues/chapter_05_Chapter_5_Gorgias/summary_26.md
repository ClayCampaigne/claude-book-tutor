- Punishment’s purpose is twofold: curative for the “curable,” who are improved by pain (in this life and the next), and exemplary for the “incurable,” whose perpetual torments deter others. The worst, incurable offenders are typically those with great power (tyrants, kings, public men), since power enables the greatest impieties; Homer’s Tantalus, Sisyphus, and Tityus exemplify this. Archelaus would be among them if Polus spoke truly. Private villains lack the power to commit the worst crimes and are comparatively “happier.” Rare but admirable exceptions exist among the powerful (e.g., Aristeides).

- Postmortem judging: Rhadamanthus assesses souls impartially, branding them curable/incurable; just souls—likely philosophers who “mind their own work” rather than busying in public affairs—are sent to the Islands of the Blessed. Aeacus judges likewise; Minos presides with a golden scepter.

- Socrates declares he lives to present an undefiled soul, renouncing honors for truth and the good life/death. He exhorts Callicles to the “great combat” (virtue), warning he will be helpless before Aeacus if unjust. Lacking a better account, the moral stands: doing injustice is worse than suffering it; reality, not appearance, of virtue must be pursued; if one errs, just punishment is second-best; shun all flattery; use rhetoric only in service of justice. Practice virtue first; only then, if at all, take up politics. The best life is persistent practice of justice and every virtue; Callicles’ path is worthless.
