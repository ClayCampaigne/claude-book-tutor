- Socrates extends the “order vs flattery” schema to the soul: as health/strength result from bodily order, so “law” and “lawfulness” are the soul’s order, yielding temperance and justice. The true rhetorician must aim to implant justice/temperance and remove their opposites, not dispense pleasant “doses” that harm. Like physicians restraining the sick, one must restrain and chastise a disordered soul for its own good. Callicles balks and withdraws; Gorgias urges Socrates to continue.

- Socrates recaps key conclusions: 
  - Pleasant ≠ good; pleasures are for the sake of the good. 
  - Virtue in anything arises from order, truth, and art; an orderly soul is temperate, hence just, pious, courageous, and therefore good—and so happy. The intemperate is miserable.
  - Therefore, to be happy, pursue temperance and flee intemperance; if oneself or one’s city needs correction, accept just punishment as a condition of happiness. The intemperate, being incapable of “communion,” is friend to neither gods nor men; the cosmos itself is bound by order and “geometrical equality.”

- These premises vindicate earlier theses: better to be punished than to escape; doing injustice is worse than suffering; the true rhetorician must be just.

- Replying to Callicles’ taunt of helplessness, Socrates redefines real “defence” as averting the greatest evil—doing injustice (worse still if unpunished). To avoid suffering injustice one needs power; to avoid doing it one needs not mere will but power/art. He recalls the concession that no one does wrong voluntarily; Callicles grudgingly assents.
