- Plato’s stock of extended images concentrates in the Republic: the composite animal (man/lion/many‑headed beast), the “great beast” (the populace), the wild beast within (passions), philosophy as a dishonoured maiden, the tyrant as parricide, the dog as “only philosopher,” headless/veiled/chasing arguments, and the “three waves.” Theaetetus’ “midwifery” is the chief exception. He also uses mathematical schemata (the “number of the state”; interval from king to tyrant).

- Gorgias’ closing myth sketches postmortem judgment: bodylike souls and judges meet “naked,” with no concealment; Zeus removes foresight of death; there are paradisal, purgatorial, and infernal fates, the last only for great criminals. Its didactic aim intrudes on the picture.

- Phaedo’s myth is more cosmological/poetic: a purer “upper” earth, our world as sediment; mixed soul–body imagery; Acheron’s purifications; incurables in Tartarus; “hardly curable” beg victims for release. Plato blends philosophy and mythology, accepting inconsistency to convey moral truth.

- Republic X’s myth (Er) is subtler/more lifelike: timed cycles, fallible choices (especially by the conventionally good), chance’s role, Lethe’s excess, Odyssean weariness; grand judging scenes. It too mixes cosmic model and judgment day.

- These myths carry “mystery/Orphic” and quasi‑Egyptian tones, offered not as literal truth but as the best sayable beyond knowledge: after death, judgment; the good fare better.

- Phaedrus’ myth treats preexistence and the “spiritual combat” (reason with noble passion vs lust), using recollection as figurative ethics.

- Statesman’s myth imagines reversed cosmic cycles: Cronos’ innocent, God‑governed age without property/family/tradition vs Zeus’ human self‑government; raises prospects of innocence, secularization, and social invention.

- Stylistic note: Plato fuses abstract and concrete; vivid, simple myth plus sacred names makes moral vision persuasive despite broken metaphors.
