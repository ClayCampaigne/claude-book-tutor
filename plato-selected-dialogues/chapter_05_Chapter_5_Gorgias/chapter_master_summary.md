<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Plato’s Gorgias begins as an inquiry into rhetoric and widens into a comprehensive ethical-political critique. True to Plato’s dramatic method, the dialogue has organic unity without a single thesis: its strands converge on a central opposition between genuine arts that care for body and soul and sham “flatteries” that merely gratify. Socrates recasts rhetoric as a branch of flattery opposed to justice, advances paradoxes against common opinion—doing injustice is worse than suffering it; it is better for the wrongdoer to be punished; all desire is for the good; pleasure is not identical with the good—and presses the claim that real power is the capacity to achieve what is truly beneficial, not merely what seems best to the many.

The drama ascends through three interlocutors. Gorgias, treated respectfully, cannot ground rhetoric beyond producing belief in civic crowds and slips when he both claims to teach justice and absolves rhetoric’s misuse. With Polus, Socrates reduces rhetoric to “cookery,” secures that doing wrong is more harmful (hence worse) than suffering wrong, and argues that just punishment heals the soul. Callicles, a worldly defender of “nature” as might and of unbounded gratification, attacks philosophy and exalts pleasure. Socrates counters with images of order (sound vs leaky jars), exposes contradictions in equating pleasure with the good, and wins Callicles’ retreat to a standard of beneficial vs harmful pleasures—reinstating knowledge of the good as the measure. True politics, Socrates insists, imposes discipline and implants temperance and justice; celebrated Athenian leaders flattered rather than improved the demos. Rhetoric is worthy only when serving justice—even in self-accusation.

The dialogue closes with a myth of naked postmortem judgment before Rhadamanthus, Aeacus, and Minos, where punishments are curative for the corrigible and exemplary for the incurable, often powerful men. Socrates accepts earthly condemnation and claims to be the only true politician in the higher, moral sense. Jowett notes Plato’s poetic looseness and strained analogies but emphasizes the ethical idealism: happiness lies in truth and right, not in pleasure or reputation; the wise must oppose flattering opinion, use rhetoric only for the good, and practice virtue before politics.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Framing: Plato’s dialogues have organic unity but multiple strands; avoid forcing a single thesis. Gorgias similarly begins with rhetoric but widens into a comprehensive ethical-political critique.

- Central opposition: true arts that care for body and soul vs sham “flatteries” or simulations. Rhetoric is one branch of flattery, opposed to disciplines that genuinely improve.

- Socratic “paradoxes” (to common opinion): 
  1) Doing injustice is worse than suffering it. 
  2) Having done wrong, it is better to be punished than to escape. 
  3) The bad do what they think best, not what they truly desire, since all desire is for the good.
  - Pleasure ≠ good: pleasure can coexist with pain and be as great or greater for the bad as for the good.

- Scope of critique: not only rhetoricians but poets, musicians, and statesmen are often mere flatterers; the true vs false is ultimately revealed in a postmortem judgment where rhetoric is useless.

- Dramatic structure and tones:
  - Gorgias: asked to define rhetoric; contradicts himself when unwilling to detach rhetoric from justice; treated respectfully but shown unable to ground his art.
  - Polus: impetuous defender claims rhetoric/despots wield great power; Socrates reduces rhetoric to “cookery,” denies real power, and leads Polus to concede the paradoxes’ implications.
  - Callicles: worldly cynic defends pleasure as good, “might is right,” and law as the weak’s conspiracy; resists, grows irritated, and partly withdraws. Socrates distinguishes higher statesmanship (improvement) from lower (flattery), exhorts Callicles to the higher, and closes with a myth of final judgment.

- Character sketches: Gorgias—celebrated, generous, vain, dialectically weak; Polus—talented, dazzled by power, yet educable; Callicles—ambitious materialist admiring strong leaders, hostile to philosophy, wielding rhetoric as power.

- Socrates: increasingly ironic and provoking, adapting his tone to opponents while relentlessly pressing the ethical core.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Callicles bristles when Socrates states the blunt implications of his views; he equivocates among “better,” “superior,” and “stronger,” which Socrates exploits. He stays engaged largely out of deference to Gorgias, and briefly concedes truths about the ambitious citizen’s need to mirror the people.

- Socrates is at his most ironical yet deeply earnest, anticipating earthly condemnation but postmortem vindication; the closing doctrine affirms: doing wrong is worse than suffering it; being just is better than seeming; if unjust, correction is second-best; avoid flattery; rhetoric must serve the right. He pointedly calls himself the only true politician—in a higher, moral sense. Jowett notes Plato’s loose dramatic dating.

- Dramatic start: Socrates, with Chaerephon, goes to Callicles’ house to question Gorgias “what he is,” not to hear a show. Polus answers floridly; Gorgias succinctly says he’s a rhetorician who can speak “as long or as short as he pleases.”

- Elenchus on rhetoric’s nature:
  - Rhetoric is a word‑art, but so are many arts; its distinct object must be specified.
  - Gorgias first says it treats “the greatest human things” and that persuasion gives freedom and power; under pressure, he narrows: rhetoric persuades assemblies and courts about just/unjust.
  - Socrates distinguishes persuasion to knowledge vs mere belief; rhetoric in civic fora yields belief, not knowledge, since crowds can’t be taught quickly; technical questions belong to experts.
  - Gorgias boasts rhetoric can out‑persuade experts and disclaims responsibility for pupils’ misuse.

- Socrates draws an inconsistency: if rhetoric teaches justice, the rhetorician would be just, yet rhetoric can be used unjustly. Jowett flags the slide from knowing to being just. Polus, irritated, takes over the questioning, agreeing to keep it brief.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Socrates exposes the earlier “rhetorician-must-be-just” inference as fallacious: knowing justice ≠ being just; character can resist teaching; partial justice doesn’t preclude wrongdoing. Polus, nettled, agrees to brief Q&A.

- Definition turn: rhetoric isn’t a techne but a knack/experience that produces gratification—akin to cookery. Schema of true arts vs shams:
  - True arts: for body—gymnastic, medicine; for soul—legislation, justice (the two parts of politics).
  - Shams: for body—cosmetics (vs gymnastic), cookery (vs medicine); for soul—sophistic (vs legislation), rhetoric (vs justice).
  - When judged by mere pleasure, these get confused.

- Power dispute: Socrates denies rhetors/tyrants have “real power” (achieving the good). Doing injustice is worse than suffering it. Polus cites Archelaus (bloody usurper) as happy; Socrates rejects appeals to the many and argues by eliciting Polus’s concessions.

- First paradox secured: “foul” = more painful or more harmful; doing wrong isn’t more painful than suffering it, so it’s more harmful—therefore worse.

- Second paradox: punishment benefits the soul. Of evils—poverty (estate), disease (body), injustice (soul)—injustice is worst; cures are trading, medicine, justice, the last being fairest. Best: never do wrong; second-best: be punished. Proper use of rhetoric: self-accusation to be healed; toward enemies, prefer they go unpunished (but harmless to oneself).

- Callicles enters, asserting nature vs convention: by nature “might is right”; society tames the strong; cites Pindar/Heracles; urges Socrates to drop excessive philosophy (fine for youth, ruinous in public life).

- Socrates, treating Callicles as an ideal critic, probes “natural justice”: is it rule of the stronger or the better? If identical, the many (being stronger) make equality and the shame of doing wrong “natural” too—setting up a reductio of Callicles’ thesis.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Socrates treats Callicles as the ideal “touchstone” critic (knowledge, goodwill, frankness) and presses him to define “natural justice”: is it rule of the stronger or the better? Callicles oscillates—stronger, then wiser/”politically able,” then the self‑mastered “temperate” is mocked—before affirming an ethics of expanding desires and maximal satisfaction.

- Hedonism tested: Socrates’ images (leaky vs sound jars; soma/sema wordplay; the “sieve” of the uninitiated) aim to show a life of unending intake is wretched. Callicles embraces perpetual gratification, forcing Socrates to deploy counterexamples (itching, base desires), exposing the cost of equating pleasure with the good.

- Key refutation: pleasure and pain can be simultaneous, but good and evil cannot; if pleasure=good, cowards and villains who often feel more pleasure would be “better”—absurd. Callicles retreats to “good pleasures = beneficial,” conceding pleasure ≠ good and returning to Socrates’ earlier standard: choose what benefits the soul.

- Reinstated schema: true arts (medicine, legislation/justice) aim at order and virtue; flatteries (cookery, sophistic, rhetoric, much poetry/tragedy) chase pleasure. Socrates denies that even famed statesmen (Themistocles, Cimon, Miltiades, Pericles) truly improved citizens; the real statesman-physician imposes discipline and implants virtue.

- Ethical upshot: virtue = order/harmony; temperance entails justice, courage, piety, and happiness. Doing wrong is worst; if wrong is done, punishment heals. Rhetoric’s only worthy use is self‑accusation. Mere life‑preserving “arts” (pilot, engineer) show survival ≠ virtue. To sway the demos one must resemble them—hence flattery’s danger. Socrates closes by proposing to “examine” Callicles’ statesmanly credentials: whom has he made better?
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Socrates urges Callicles to value living “best” over mere survival; real political influence requires becoming like the people, which Socrates refuses. He proposes a test for statesmanship: has one made citizens better? By this measure, famed leaders (Pericles, Cimon, Miltiades, Themistocles) failed—Pericles’ pay policy pampered and worsened the demos, who later condemned him. They built docks and harbors but neglected virtue, like cooks fattening patients whom physicians must later cure. Flatterers will eventually be punished by the very crowd they indulged; Callicles and Alcibiades risk the same fate.

- True politics is the higher, corrective “art” that forms character and does not trade for pay; rhetoric is the inferior, pleasure‑serving craft. Callicles admits he invites Socrates only to the “ministerial” path that avoids death. Socrates accepts likely condemnation, likening himself to a physician judged by children, and defines true self‑help as never doing wrong.

- Eschatological myth: postmortem judges (Rhadamanthus, Aeacus, Minos) assess naked souls; punishments divide into curable (reformative) and incurable (exemplary, often kings like Archelaus). The aim is to present a pure soul; death itself is not the worst evil—arriving guilty is.

- Exhortation: be rather than seem; practice virtue first, then politics.

- Jowett’s critique: the dialogue shows pre‑logical ambiguities (definitions; nature vs convention; good vs pleasure), and Socrates’ refutations sometimes rest on dubious contrasts and analogies. Yet Plato’s “ideal” aims at the idea of happiness as moral rightness (like honoring martyrs), not pleasure calculus; he also affirms a duty to share discovered truth.
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Jowett underscores Plato’s ethical idealism: true happiness lies in truth and right, not in pleasure, fame, or utility; we admire sufferers for justice even when pain isn’t offset by felt satisfaction. Plato is not merely self-regarding; in antiquity care for others is embedded in politics, and Socrates stresses sharing truth.

- To “justify the ways of God,” Plato supplements the present world’s injustice with postmortem recompense: few tyrants are incurable examples; most are corrigible, and punishment is meant to heal. Jowett notes the limits of Plato’s analogies (disease/medicine for injustice/justice), the conflation of images with realities, and the lack of a worked-out mechanism for moral growth via punishment, though the Republic hints at educative development beyond death.

- Main aim of Gorgias: oppose true vs false life and human opinions vs true judgment, using a superhuman ideal that nonetheless shapes aspiration and critiques real politics.

- Subordinate themes:
  a) Good vs pleasure: Plato ties good to permanence/objectivity and pleasure to flux; Jowett flags the asymmetry and subjectivity issues.
  b) “Flatteries”: arts severed from truth/improvement (rhetoric, sophistry, much poetry) cater to opinion; the lone wise person prizes virtue.
  c) Links to Republic, Philebus, Protagoras: shared critiques of poets/rhetors; different treatments of pleasure; common motifs of measure, order, and persuasion.
  d) Minor notes: Socratic ironies (pilot’s fee; rhetoric as self-accusation; “geometrical equality”); myth echoes dialogue themes (naked souls/judges; exemplary tyrants); Homeric embellishment.

- Methodological cautions: Plato is dramatic and poetic; speakers needn’t voice his settled views; avoid judging historical figures from the dialogue.
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Jowett notes Plato’s mythic “fiction” forces a quasi-corporeal postmortem soul and invokes Homer (Minos with a golden scepter) to lend plausibility. He cautions against reading the dialogue as history or as Plato’s literal voice; Plato plays “both sides,” is poet-dramatist as well as philosopher.

- “Right of dissent”: Plato isn’t asserting modern free-thought; rather, the duty/right of the one wise person to oppose the many’s folly, accepting Socrates’ likely fate. His irony shields and reveals high idealism; he appears paradoxical yet appeals to higher reason.

- Four main theses distilled:
  1) Doing injustice is worse than suffering it: moral evil alone is truly evil; tyrants remain miserable despite success; principles must not sink to practice; the real harm is present degradation of the soul.
  2) It is better to be punished than to escape: hidden consequences educate character; unpunished wrong is greatest misfortune; paradoxical “retaliation” is to let enemies go unpunished; use rhetoric inwardly for self-accusation to correct oneself.
  3) We do what we “wish,” not what we truly will: uninformed good intentions backfire; hence “virtue is knowledge” as a needed half-truth linking right and consequences.
  4) To be, not to seem: praise-seeking breeds conscious/unconscious hypocrisy; entrenched “sophistries” of professions, parties, and institutions outstrip ancient sophists in deceiving.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- “To be, not to seem” is sharpened into a social-ethical critique: hypocrisy and sophistry pervade classes and professions (law, medicine, politics, theology), and unconscious hypocrisy is worst. Inherited conventions, party and pecuniary interests, and the “world” (our collective social influence) habituate most people to think by others’ opinions rather than their own.

- Socrates’ remedy: cultivate the will to be rather than appear—confess ignorance, learn to do well, gain firmness and consistency, care about serious questions, and judge for oneself. Show the same principle in secret as in public; at need, even ordinary persons can oppose entire establishments for truth and right.

- True vs false statesman:
  - True: brings order from disorder; unites freedom with order; aims at an ideal polity—equal chances of health and life, highest education for all, free development of moral and intellectual powers, governed by the idea of the good. He self-masters, subordinates private enmity, plans for generations, times reforms patiently, “educates his party” toward the common good, appeals to the better public opinion, and relies on permanent political principles. He leads while winning the majority, balances doing for the people what they cannot do themselves, allows for chance, serves the whole, lives for the future, and may go unthanked.
  - False: becomes like the populace, chases expediency and measures that merely “pass,” starts with popularity but fails in crisis and earns justified disesteem.

- Democratic drift: governing for vs by the people is hard; class interests resist comprehensive views; the true governor risks ruin.

- Socrates as “the only real politician”: in effect, seminal thinkers (e.g., Locke, Hume, Adam Smith, Bentham, Ricardo) are the true statesmen who seed ideas later realized; practical politicians mostly execute others’ thoughts, with rare creators (e.g., Cavour). Philosophers, though politically ill-suited, shape the future and are honored posthumously.
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Thinkers vs practitioners: The seeds sown by philosophers become the next generation’s irresistible political power. An “ideal statesman” could unite theory and practice, but typically politicians execute others’ ideas; rare creators (e.g., Cavour) “make” their world. Philosophers are ill-suited to day-to-day politics and are misunderstood, yet their quieter lives may be happier and honored posthumously.

- True poet/artist: Plato expels poets (Republic) and demotes tragic art (Gorgias) as pleasure-serving imitations. Against modern disdain for “moral” art, Jowett insists the poet/novelist’s proper office is ethical: to clothe noble truths in beauty, deepen and elevate common moral and political principles, guide to higher pleasures, and improve citizens. Much modern art is “flattery” lacking order, measure, or soul-care.

- Core upshot: Art, politics, and life must be true, bringing order from disorder and truth from error—the greatest human improvement—leaving outcomes to God. Plato intimates postmortem correction (purgatory for most, Tartarus for few); myths veil, not reveal, the invisible. He upholds the ultimate triumph of truth/right, avoids Stoic extremity (happiness on the rack), and argues martyrdom can be happy in the act of right itself, even absent afterlife expectation; the highest service is disinterested (Christ cited).

- Plato’s mythmaking: Catalog of major afterlife/psychological myths (Phaedrus 244–256; Phaedo 110–115; Gorgias 523–527; Republic X 614–621) and other fables/parables (Statesman, Timaeus/Critias’ Atlantis, Laws, Protagoras, Symposium, Republic’s Cave, earthborn men, “great beast,” etc.), plus recurring images (sun, composite animal, bees, tyrant as parricide, argument “veiling her face,” three “waves”), used repeatedly to illuminate arguments.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Plato’s stock of extended images concentrates in the Republic: the composite animal (man/lion/many‑headed beast), the “great beast” (the populace), the wild beast within (passions), philosophy as a dishonoured maiden, the tyrant as parricide, the dog as “only philosopher,” headless/veiled/chasing arguments, and the “three waves.” Theaetetus’ “midwifery” is the chief exception. He also uses mathematical schemata (the “number of the state”; interval from king to tyrant).

- Gorgias’ closing myth sketches postmortem judgment: bodylike souls and judges meet “naked,” with no concealment; Zeus removes foresight of death; there are paradisal, purgatorial, and infernal fates, the last only for great criminals. Its didactic aim intrudes on the picture.

- Phaedo’s myth is more cosmological/poetic: a purer “upper” earth, our world as sediment; mixed soul–body imagery; Acheron’s purifications; incurables in Tartarus; “hardly curable” beg victims for release. Plato blends philosophy and mythology, accepting inconsistency to convey moral truth.

- Republic X’s myth (Er) is subtler/more lifelike: timed cycles, fallible choices (especially by the conventionally good), chance’s role, Lethe’s excess, Odyssean weariness; grand judging scenes. It too mixes cosmic model and judgment day.

- These myths carry “mystery/Orphic” and quasi‑Egyptian tones, offered not as literal truth but as the best sayable beyond knowledge: after death, judgment; the good fare better.

- Phaedrus’ myth treats preexistence and the “spiritual combat” (reason with noble passion vs lust), using recollection as figurative ethics.

- Statesman’s myth imagines reversed cosmic cycles: Cronos’ innocent, God‑governed age without property/family/tradition vs Zeus’ human self‑government; raises prospects of innocence, secularization, and social invention.

- Stylistic note: Plato fuses abstract and concrete; vivid, simple myth plus sacred names makes moral vision persuasive despite broken metaphors.
</CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>
- Jowett’s bridge from myth to method: Plato’s “Cronos” tale hints at possibilities—a state of innocence, a world without traditions, and contrast between divine vs human government—while extending his thought-experiments about abolishing family and property (as in the ideal state). He praises Plato’s language for uniting poetry/prose and speech/writing, moving fluidly between visible and unseen, using vivid, conversational myths and “broken” metaphors that work by overall effect rather than strict consistency.

- Gorgias scene setup: At Callicles’ house, Socrates arrives late; Chaerephon secures a Q&A “exhibition.” Gorgias agrees to answer briefly; Polus tries to respond but displays rhetoric over dialectic, prompting Socrates to question Gorgias directly.

- Definitional elenchus begins:
  - Gorgias identifies his art as rhetoric and claims to make others rhetoricians.
  - To “what is rhetoric concerned with?” Gorgias answers: discourse. Socrates shows many arts use discourse (medicine, gymnastic; arithmetic, calculation, geometry, astronomy).
  - Gorgias narrows: rhetoric “works only through discourse,” not manual action. Socrates notes this still fits arts like arithmetic/geometry, so subject-matter must be specified.
  - Using analogies (arithmetic: odd/even; calculation: numerical relations; astronomy: celestial motions), Socrates presses “words about what?” Gorgias replies: “the greatest and best of human things,” which Socrates flags as ambiguous, inviting further precision.
</CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>
- Socrates sharpens the inquiry: many arts “use words,” so each must be defined by “words about what.” He presses Gorgias to specify rhetoric’s subject and the kind of persuasion it produces.

- Gorgias stakes rhetoric’s value as the greatest human good: it grants freedom and rule by persuading assemblies, councils, and courts. Rhetoric is “the artificer of persuasion,” making even physicians, trainers, and moneymakers “slaves” to the skilled speaker.

- Socrates introduces a key distinction: learning/knowledge vs belief. Since belief can be false but knowledge cannot, there are two kinds of persuasion—one producing knowledge, the other mere belief. Gorgias concedes rhetoric yields belief (without teaching) about the just and unjust, especially because large audiences cannot be instructed in a short time.

- Socrates notes technical choices (physicians, shipwrights, generals; building walls, docks) properly belong to experts. Gorgias replies that in practice rhetoricians prevail in such civic decisions, citing Themistocles and Pericles (e.g., the “middle wall”). He boasts rhetoric can out‑persuade experts on any subject and offers an anecdote of swaying a patient where a doctor failed; a rhetor could even win election as state‑physician.

- Ethical caveat: like boxing, the art isn’t blameworthy if misused; responsibility lies with the user. Rhetoric’s power should be exercised “fairly,” not to defraud genuine experts.
</CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>
- Gorgias defends rhetoric and its teachers: like boxing, the art itself is good; only misuse warrants blame and punishment, not the instructor. Rhetoric can persuade any crowd on any topic but ought to be used “fairly.”

- Socrates cautions that disputes often sour, then asks whether Gorgias will accept refutation for truth’s sake. The audience urges continuation; Gorgias agrees.

- Socrates secures key admissions: rhetoric persuades the ignorant more than experts; the rhetorician need not know truths but can seem to know them to the many.

- On justice, Socrates forces a fork: either pupils already know just/unjust, or Gorgias must teach it. Gorgias accepts he teaches it. Socrates infers: whoever learns justice is just, always wants and does the just; hence a trained rhetorician would never commit injustice—contradicting Gorgias’s earlier allowance that rhetors might use rhetoric unjustly while the teacher remains blameless.

- Polus protests that Socrates engineered a contradiction by shaming; Socrates insists on brief, reciprocal Q&A.

- Polus asks “What is rhetoric?” Socrates: it is not a techne but an empeiria—an experience producing pleasure/gratification—setting up the cookery analogy (“not an art”), and the forthcoming schema of true arts vs flattering knacks.
</CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>
- Polus presses “what is rhetoric?” Socrates answers: not a techne but an experience that produces gratification. He aligns it with flattery, using cookery as the model: both please without knowledge of the good.

- Body/soul schema: each has real arts that secure true well-being vs simulations that only seem to. 
  - Body’s arts: gymnastic, medicine. 
  - Soul’s arts (politics): legislation, justice. 
  - Flattering shams: cosmetics (“tiring”) mimics gymnastic; cookery mimics medicine; sophistry mimics legislation; rhetoric mimics justice. These chase pleasure, not the best, and cannot give a logos (account), so are not arts.

- Proportional analogies: tiring:gymnastic::cookery:medicine; tiring:gymnastic::sophistry:legislation; cookery:medicine::rhetoric:justice. Rhetoric is the “ghost/counterfeit” of a part of politics and ignoble.

- If pleasure were the judge (as if the body judged), true arts would be confounded with shams—“Chaos” (Anaxagoras) would ensue.

- Power dispute: Socrates denies rhetors are truly powerful. He distinguishes doing what seems best from doing what one wills: we will ends (the good), not the painful/indifferent means (medicine, sailing). Actions like killing, exiling, despoiling are done under the belief they conduce to good. Thus tyrants/rhetors don’t “do as they will” unless they know the good; if ignorant, they lack real power. Polus must show rhetoric is knowledge (not flattery) to refute this.
</CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 15 SUMMARY>
- Socrates sharpens the “power” argument by distinguishing ends from means: agents will the good (end) for which they act, not the intermediate acts (often indifferent: walking, sailing; or even killing, exile, confiscation). If a tyrant/rhetor does what seems best but it is not truly good, he does not do what he wills; hence he lacks “great power” (which must benefit its possessor).

- Against Polus’s envy of those who can “do as they please” justly or unjustly, Socrates replies: unjust doers are to be pitied, not envied; doing injustice is worse than suffering it, and he would choose suffering over doing wrong.

- Dagger analogy: the mere capacity to harm at will isn’t real power because it predictably brings punishment, which Polus concedes is an evil. True power is action that turns to one’s advantage; acts like killing/exiling/confiscating are good only when just, evil when unjust.

- Polus cites Archelaus of Macedon as an unjust yet happy ruler, narrating his murders. Socrates rejects “witness”-style refutation by reputation or numbers; truth requires dialectic and persuading the single interlocutor. He maintains happiness hinges on justice/education: the good are happy; the unjust miserable.

- Positions crystallize: Polus—unjust unpunished are happy, punished are miserable; Socrates—the unjust are miserable regardless, more so if unpunished, less so if punished (anticipating punishment as a benefit to the soul).
</CHUNK 15 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 16 SUMMARY>
- Polus affirms: the unjust are happy if unpunished, miserable if punished. Socrates counters: unjust doers are miserable either way—more so if unpunished, less so if punished.

- Socrates rejects appeals to the many and seeks Polus’s single assent. He elicits key concessions:
  - Doing wrong is “more disgraceful” than suffering wrong, though suffering is “worse.”
  - Beauty/disgrace are measured by pleasure/usefulness vs pain/harm. Hence, if doing wrong is more disgraceful but not more painful than suffering, it must be more harmful; therefore, doing injustice is a greater evil than suffering it. Polus agrees.

- Turning to punishment, Socrates argues:
  - The patient’s affection matches the agent’s act; punishment is suffering imposed by a just punisher, thus the punished “suffers justly.”
  - The just is honorable; the honorable is pleasant or useful; therefore, being justly punished is good and beneficial.
  - “Beneficial” = the soul is improved; punishment delivers from the evil of the soul.

- Tripartite evils:
  - Estate: poverty; Body: disease; Soul: injustice/ignorance/intemperance—most disgraceful and thus the worst (most harmful).
  - Corresponding “cures”: moneymaking removes poverty; medicine removes disease; justice (right punishment) removes vice/injustice.

- Conclusion: it is better for the wrongdoer to be punished than to escape; escaping leaves one in the greatest evil.
</CHUNK 16 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 17 SUMMARY>
- Socrates seals the prior argument by shifting from “painfulness” to “harmfulness”: if vice (evil of the soul) is most disgraceful yet not more painful than bodily or external ills, its excess of disgrace must come from its greater harmfulness; thus injustice/intemperance are the greatest evils.

- Corresponding “arts” cure each domain: moneymaking cures poverty; medicine cures disease; justice (through judges’ rightful punishment) cures vice. Justice is “medicine” for the soul.

- Ranking of conditions:
  - Best: never to have vice.
  - Second-best: to be punished/admonished and thereby cured.
  - Worst: to commit great crimes and escape correction (e.g., Archelaus, tyrants, flattering rhetors).
  - Analogy: evading punishment = a patient refusing painful surgery; such people use money, friends, and persuasion to avoid the cure.

- Practical upshot on rhetoric:
  - For the just life, rhetoric is useful only to accuse oneself and one’s associates so they receive due penalties and are healed; accept scourging, bonds, fines, exile, even death.
  - If one aims to harm enemies, rhetoric’s “use” is to help them evade punishment and persist in wickedness.

- Callicles intervenes, calling Socrates’ conclusions world-inverting. Socrates replies that he merely echoes philosophy—constant unlike Alcibiades/Demos—and challenges Callicles to refute the claim that doing injustice unpunished is worst, else live in inner discord.

- Callicles’ counter-thesis (physis vs nomos): Socrates traps interlocutors by toggling between convention and nature. By nature, suffering injustice is worse (hence more disgraceful) and is slavish; “justice” as equality is a convention made by the weak majority to restrain the naturally stronger/better from having more (pleonexia).
</CHUNK 17 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 18 SUMMARY>
- Callicles articulates a “nature vs convention” thesis: by nature, suffering injustice is worse (a greater evil) and “justice” is the stronger/better taking more and ruling the weaker; “laws” are inventions of the weak majority to shackle the naturally superior and brand pleonexia (having more) as unjust. He appeals to examples (Xerxes’ conquests, Heracles in Pindar) to legitimate might-as-right.

- He attacks philosophy beyond youth: in adults it breeds ignorance of civic practice, human desires, and courtroom speech, rendering one helpless if accused; he urges Socrates to abandon refutation, learn practical rhetoric/politics, and pursue reputation and wealth.

- Socrates welcomes Callicles as a “touchstone” (knowledge, goodwill, frankness), recalling Callicles’ own prior counsel not to overdo philosophy, and asks guidance on the best life.

- Pinning down “natural justice,” Socrates gets Callicles to equate superior, better, and stronger. Socrates then argues: if superior=stronger, the many are superior to the one; therefore their laws are by nature the laws of the superior/better and thus “by nature good.” But the many hold that justice is equality and that doing injustice is more disgraceful than suffering it. Hence, on Callicles’ own premises, nature and convention align here, undercutting his claimed opposition. Callicles dismisses this as nonsense.
</CHUNK 18 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 19 SUMMARY>
- Socrates exploits Callicles’ earlier equation “better = superior = stronger” to a reductio: the many are stronger, so their egalitarian laws are “by nature” best. Callicles retreats: by “better/superior” he means the wiser—specifically, capable, courageous statesmen—not mere physical strength.

- Pressed to clarify “having more,” Socrates uses a physician-and-food case to show that being “better” does not entail larger personal consumption, but right authority/distribution. Callicles rejects material analogies (food, coats, shoes), insisting he means political superiority.

- Socrates introduces “ruling oneself” as temperance (self-mastery). Callicles derides temperance as slavish. His positive thesis: natural justice is unbounded desire and maximal gratification; the naturally superior (born to rule/tyrannize) should satisfy every appetite if they have the means. Conventional praise of temperance/justice is a conspiracy of the weak to restrain the strong.

- Socrates counters with Pythagorean/Orphic images:
  - Soma/sema: body as tomb; intemperate souls are “leaky vessels” endlessly filling and losing.
  - Two-lives parable: temperate man’s sound, full casks vs intemperate man’s leaky casks requiring ceaseless refilling—arguing order/sufficiency is happier.

- Callicles replies: a “filled” life is stone-like, without ongoing pleasure; happiness is continual inflow (ever-renewed desire and satisfaction). Socrates pushes toward a reductio by invoking base pleasures (itching/scratching), setting up the coming refutation of hedonism (pleasure ≠ good).
</CHUNK 19 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 20 SUMMARY>
- Callicles rejects the “full, sound casks” life as stone-like; happiness is continual inflow—unceasing desire and gratification (eating, drinking, etc.). Socrates pushes a reductio with “itching and scratching” and shameful sexual cases to test whether any pleasure counts as happiness. Callicles initially bites the bullet (even the scratcher lives pleasantly, hence happily) and, for consistency, asserts pleasure = good.

- Socrates then mounts a formal refutation:
  - Callicles grants knowledge and courage are distinct from pleasure; and that good and evil fortune are contraries that exclude co-presence (like health/disease).
  - He also grants desires are painful, while satisfying them is pleasant; thus, in cases like drinking while thirsty, pain and pleasure occur simultaneously and cease together.
  - Since good and evil cannot be present (or cease) together, while pleasure and pain can, the good cannot be identical with the pleasant.

- A second line: both fools/cowards and wise/brave feel pleasures and pains, with cowards often feeling more pleasure; if pleasure = good, the worse could be “better,” which is absurd.

- Pressed, Callicles retreats: not all pleasures are good; some are bad. He accepts the criterion Socrates wanted: beneficial pleasures are good; hurtful ones are evil—opening the way to evaluate pleasures by their effects on the soul.
</CHUNK 20 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 21 SUMMARY>
- Callicles retreats from “pleasure = good,” conceding that some pleasures are good and others bad; the good are the beneficial, the bad the harmful. There are likewise good and bad pains.
- Shared principle reaffirmed: all actions aim at the good; therefore pleasure is to be sought for the sake of the good, not vice versa. Discriminating good/bad pleasures requires an art/knowledge.
- Socrates reinstates his schema: 
  - True arts know natures/causes and aim at the good (e.g., medicine for bodies).
  - Knacks/experiences (flatteries) aim only at pleasure (e.g., cookery).
  - Parallel for the soul: some practices genuinely benefit it; others merely gratify, indifferent to moral betterment—these are “flattery.”
- Survey of arts shows many are pleasure‑aiming: flute/lyre/choral/dithyrambic performance and especially tragedy; stripping meter reveals poetry as a kind of rhetoric addressing mixed crowds—hence largely flattery.
- Political rhetoric divides similarly: a base kind that panders, and a noble kind that improves souls by saying what is best whether welcome or not. Callicles cannot name a living exemplar, and, when pressed, no past Athenian statesman either.
- Positive criterion for true statesmanship/rhetoric: like other arts, it uses standards to impose order/harmony. Order in body = health/strength; in soul = lawfulness producing temperance and justice. The true rhetorician aims to implant justice/temperance and remove their opposites, not merely to dispense pleasing “doses” that harm, as with feeding delicacies to the sick.
</CHUNK 21 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 22 SUMMARY>
- Socrates extends the “order vs flattery” schema to the soul: as health/strength result from bodily order, so “law” and “lawfulness” are the soul’s order, yielding temperance and justice. The true rhetorician must aim to implant justice/temperance and remove their opposites, not dispense pleasant “doses” that harm. Like physicians restraining the sick, one must restrain and chastise a disordered soul for its own good. Callicles balks and withdraws; Gorgias urges Socrates to continue.

- Socrates recaps key conclusions: 
  - Pleasant ≠ good; pleasures are for the sake of the good. 
  - Virtue in anything arises from order, truth, and art; an orderly soul is temperate, hence just, pious, courageous, and therefore good—and so happy. The intemperate is miserable.
  - Therefore, to be happy, pursue temperance and flee intemperance; if oneself or one’s city needs correction, accept just punishment as a condition of happiness. The intemperate, being incapable of “communion,” is friend to neither gods nor men; the cosmos itself is bound by order and “geometrical equality.”

- These premises vindicate earlier theses: better to be punished than to escape; doing injustice is worse than suffering; the true rhetorician must be just.

- Replying to Callicles’ taunt of helplessness, Socrates redefines real “defence” as averting the greatest evil—doing injustice (worse still if unpunished). To avoid suffering injustice one needs power; to avoid doing it one needs not mere will but power/art. He recalls the concession that no one does wrong voluntarily; Callicles grudgingly assents.
</CHUNK 22 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 23 SUMMARY>
- Socrates reframes “defence” as averting the greatest evils, ranked: worst is doing injustice; worse still is doing it and escaping punishment. To avoid suffering injustice one needs power; to avoid doing it one needs power plus art. Callicles grants the earlier thesis that no one does wrong voluntarily and agrees that “power and art” are needed to avoid wrongdoing.

- The “art” of avoiding suffering injustice, Socrates says, is to be a ruler/tyrant or their close companion. But tyrants only befriend those like themselves—neither their betters (whom they fear) nor inferiors (whom they despise). So the aspiring youth must mimic the tyrant’s likes/dislikes to be safe—thereby doing injustice and corrupting his soul, which is the greatest evil.

- Against Callicles’ boast that imitators can kill and plunder non‑imitators, Socrates distinguishes life‑preserving “arts” (swimming, piloting, engineering) from soul‑improving ones: saving lives without curing vicious souls benefits no one; mere survival is not the noble or good. Hence rhetoric’s self‑vaunting is misplaced.

- Political lesson: to win the demos, one must become like them; seeking power without conforming to the city is illusory and risks one’s dearest good (soul). Reaffirming two trainings—flattery for pleasure vs discipline for the good—Socrates says true politics must make citizens good; external goods are useless without a good mind.

- Competence test for statesmanship: as with builders or physicians, show teachers and results. Socrates challenges Callicles to name anyone he has actually improved—setting the criterion for genuine political art.
</CHUNK 23 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 24 SUMMARY>
- Socrates applies a competence test: as with builders or state-physicians, one shouldn’t “begin with the big jar” (attempt public works or public cure) without private proofs of success. He challenges Callicles, now a public aspirant, to name anyone—citizen or slave—whom he has made better (less unjust, intemperate, or foolish). Callicles won’t answer.

- Reaffirming the statesman’s true aim—improving citizens—Socrates re-examines Pericles, Cimon, Miltiades, and Themistocles. If they were good, Athenians should have become gentler and more just. Instead, the people turned savagely on them (fines, ostracism, exile, near-death), like poorly managed animals becoming fiercer. Thus they did not truly improve the city; at best they were superior “servants” who gratified popular desires and built docks, walls, and fleets.

- Recasting his body/soul schema: purveyors (bakers, cooks, weavers, shoemakers) minister cravings, whereas the true ruling arts—gymnastic and medicine for the body—should govern them. Analogously for the soul, genuine political care (law/justice) must rule over rhetoric/supply. Callicles’ heroes are like indulgent caterers who fatten patients, leaving a long-run “disease” (an ulcerated city lacking justice/temperance). When crisis comes, the crowd blames current advisers, while the earlier flatterers were the real authors; Callicles and Alcibiades risk becoming targets.

- Strong claim: “No statesman is unjustly put to death by his own city.” Like sophists who say they teach virtue yet complain pupils wrong them, orators betray by such complaints that they failed to make citizens just. Socrates equates rhetors and sophists (calling sophistry “superior” to rhetoric as legislation is to litigation, gymnastic to medicine), and argues that true improvers could trust payment to the benefited; people act unjustly from vice, not from lack of speed or skill.
</CHUNK 24 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 25 SUMMARY>
- Socrates elevates sophistry over courtroom rhetoric: as legislation surpasses litigation and gymnastic surpasses medicine, sophistry (framing norms) is higher than rhetoric (pleading cases). Orators and sophists refute themselves if they complain of being wronged by those they “taught,” since true improvers would produce just pupils. A trainer might be defrauded due to the pupil’s injustice; but one who truly removes injustice “cannot be treated unjustly” and could safely leave payment to the benefited. Hence it is honorable to take fees for technical advice (building, etc.), but dishonorable to sell counsel on how to live and govern best—such benefits alone rightly elicit voluntary requital.

- Pressed to choose, Callicles invites Socrates to be a state “servant/flatterer.” Socrates rejects threats, claiming he alone practises true politics—aiming at what is best, not most pleasant—and will be defenseless in court like a physician judged by children at a cook’s indictment. The only real defense is never doing wrong; fear injustice, not death.

- Eschatological myth: Zeus reforms judgment so naked souls are tried after death by naked, dead judges—Rhadamanthus (Asia), Aeacus (Europe), with Minos presiding—at a meadow where roads part to the Islands of the Blessed or to Tartarus. Souls carry visible moral “scars”; powerful men (tyrants, kings) often appear deformed by luxury and lawlessness and are dispatched to punishment. Punishment has two aims: to improve curable sinners through suffering, and to display incurables in perpetual torment as warnings; Archelaus typifies the latter if Polus’s account is true.
</CHUNK 25 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 26 SUMMARY>
- Punishment’s purpose is twofold: curative for the “curable,” who are improved by pain (in this life and the next), and exemplary for the “incurable,” whose perpetual torments deter others. The worst, incurable offenders are typically those with great power (tyrants, kings, public men), since power enables the greatest impieties; Homer’s Tantalus, Sisyphus, and Tityus exemplify this. Archelaus would be among them if Polus spoke truly. Private villains lack the power to commit the worst crimes and are comparatively “happier.” Rare but admirable exceptions exist among the powerful (e.g., Aristeides).

- Postmortem judging: Rhadamanthus assesses souls impartially, branding them curable/incurable; just souls—likely philosophers who “mind their own work” rather than busying in public affairs—are sent to the Islands of the Blessed. Aeacus judges likewise; Minos presides with a golden scepter.

- Socrates declares he lives to present an undefiled soul, renouncing honors for truth and the good life/death. He exhorts Callicles to the “great combat” (virtue), warning he will be helpless before Aeacus if unjust. Lacking a better account, the moral stands: doing injustice is worse than suffering it; reality, not appearance, of virtue must be pursued; if one errs, just punishment is second-best; shun all flattery; use rhetoric only in service of justice. Practice virtue first; only then, if at all, take up politics. The best life is persistent practice of justice and every virtue; Callicles’ path is worthless.
