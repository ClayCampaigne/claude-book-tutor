- Polus affirms: the unjust are happy if unpunished, miserable if punished. Socrates counters: unjust doers are miserable either way—more so if unpunished, less so if punished.

- Socrates rejects appeals to the many and seeks Polus’s single assent. He elicits key concessions:
  - Doing wrong is “more disgraceful” than suffering wrong, though suffering is “worse.”
  - Beauty/disgrace are measured by pleasure/usefulness vs pain/harm. Hence, if doing wrong is more disgraceful but not more painful than suffering, it must be more harmful; therefore, doing injustice is a greater evil than suffering it. Polus agrees.

- Turning to punishment, Socrates argues:
  - The patient’s affection matches the agent’s act; punishment is suffering imposed by a just punisher, thus the punished “suffers justly.”
  - The just is honorable; the honorable is pleasant or useful; therefore, being justly punished is good and beneficial.
  - “Beneficial” = the soul is improved; punishment delivers from the evil of the soul.

- Tripartite evils:
  - Estate: poverty; Body: disease; Soul: injustice/ignorance/intemperance—most disgraceful and thus the worst (most harmful).
  - Corresponding “cures”: moneymaking removes poverty; medicine removes disease; justice (right punishment) removes vice/injustice.

- Conclusion: it is better for the wrongdoer to be punished than to escape; escaping leaves one in the greatest evil.
