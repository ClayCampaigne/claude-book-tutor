- Thinkers vs practitioners: The seeds sown by philosophers become the next generation’s irresistible political power. An “ideal statesman” could unite theory and practice, but typically politicians execute others’ ideas; rare creators (e.g., Cavour) “make” their world. Philosophers are ill-suited to day-to-day politics and are misunderstood, yet their quieter lives may be happier and honored posthumously.

- True poet/artist: Plato expels poets (Republic) and demotes tragic art (Gorgias) as pleasure-serving imitations. Against modern disdain for “moral” art, Jowett insists the poet/novelist’s proper office is ethical: to clothe noble truths in beauty, deepen and elevate common moral and political principles, guide to higher pleasures, and improve citizens. Much modern art is “flattery” lacking order, measure, or soul-care.

- Core upshot: Art, politics, and life must be true, bringing order from disorder and truth from error—the greatest human improvement—leaving outcomes to God. Plato intimates postmortem correction (purgatory for most, Tartarus for few); myths veil, not reveal, the invisible. He upholds the ultimate triumph of truth/right, avoids Stoic extremity (happiness on the rack), and argues martyrdom can be happy in the act of right itself, even absent afterlife expectation; the highest service is disinterested (Christ cited).

- Plato’s mythmaking: Catalog of major afterlife/psychological myths (Phaedrus 244–256; Phaedo 110–115; Gorgias 523–527; Republic X 614–621) and other fables/parables (Statesman, Timaeus/Critias’ Atlantis, Laws, Protagoras, Symposium, Republic’s Cave, earthborn men, “great beast,” etc.), plus recurring images (sun, composite animal, bees, tyrant as parricide, argument “veiling her face,” three “waves”), used repeatedly to illuminate arguments.
