- Polus presses “what is rhetoric?” Socrates answers: not a techne but an experience that produces gratification. He aligns it with flattery, using cookery as the model: both please without knowledge of the good.

- Body/soul schema: each has real arts that secure true well-being vs simulations that only seem to. 
  - Body’s arts: gymnastic, medicine. 
  - Soul’s arts (politics): legislation, justice. 
  - Flattering shams: cosmetics (“tiring”) mimics gymnastic; cookery mimics medicine; sophistry mimics legislation; rhetoric mimics justice. These chase pleasure, not the best, and cannot give a logos (account), so are not arts.

- Proportional analogies: tiring:gymnastic::cookery:medicine; tiring:gymnastic::sophistry:legislation; cookery:medicine::rhetoric:justice. Rhetoric is the “ghost/counterfeit” of a part of politics and ignoble.

- If pleasure were the judge (as if the body judged), true arts would be confounded with shams—“Chaos” (Anaxagoras) would ensue.

- Power dispute: Socrates denies rhetors are truly powerful. He distinguishes doing what seems best from doing what one wills: we will ends (the good), not the painful/indifferent means (medicine, sailing). Actions like killing, exiling, despoiling are done under the belief they conduce to good. Thus tyrants/rhetors don’t “do as they will” unless they know the good; if ignorant, they lack real power. Polus must show rhetoric is knowledge (not flattery) to refute this.
