- Callicles bristles when Socrates states the blunt implications of his views; he equivocates among “better,” “superior,” and “stronger,” which Socrates exploits. He stays engaged largely out of deference to Gorgias, and briefly concedes truths about the ambitious citizen’s need to mirror the people.

- Socrates is at his most ironical yet deeply earnest, anticipating earthly condemnation but postmortem vindication; the closing doctrine affirms: doing wrong is worse than suffering it; being just is better than seeming; if unjust, correction is second-best; avoid flattery; rhetoric must serve the right. He pointedly calls himself the only true politician—in a higher, moral sense. Jowett notes Plato’s loose dramatic dating.

- Dramatic start: Socrates, with Chaerephon, goes to Callicles’ house to question Gorgias “what he is,” not to hear a show. Polus answers floridly; Gorgias succinctly says he’s a rhetorician who can speak “as long or as short as he pleases.”

- Elenchus on rhetoric’s nature:
  - Rhetoric is a word‑art, but so are many arts; its distinct object must be specified.
  - Gorgias first says it treats “the greatest human things” and that persuasion gives freedom and power; under pressure, he narrows: rhetoric persuades assemblies and courts about just/unjust.
  - Socrates distinguishes persuasion to knowledge vs mere belief; rhetoric in civic fora yields belief, not knowledge, since crowds can’t be taught quickly; technical questions belong to experts.
  - Gorgias boasts rhetoric can out‑persuade experts and disclaims responsibility for pupils’ misuse.

- Socrates draws an inconsistency: if rhetoric teaches justice, the rhetorician would be just, yet rhetoric can be used unjustly. Jowett flags the slide from knowing to being just. Polus, irritated, takes over the questioning, agreeing to keep it brief.
