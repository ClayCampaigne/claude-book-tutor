- Socrates exposes the earlier “rhetorician-must-be-just” inference as fallacious: knowing justice ≠ being just; character can resist teaching; partial justice doesn’t preclude wrongdoing. Polus, nettled, agrees to brief Q&A.

- Definition turn: rhetoric isn’t a techne but a knack/experience that produces gratification—akin to cookery. Schema of true arts vs shams:
  - True arts: for body—gymnastic, medicine; for soul—legislation, justice (the two parts of politics).
  - Shams: for body—cosmetics (vs gymnastic), cookery (vs medicine); for soul—sophistic (vs legislation), rhetoric (vs justice).
  - When judged by mere pleasure, these get confused.

- Power dispute: Socrates denies rhetors/tyrants have “real power” (achieving the good). Doing injustice is worse than suffering it. Polus cites Archelaus (bloody usurper) as happy; Socrates rejects appeals to the many and argues by eliciting Polus’s concessions.

- First paradox secured: “foul” = more painful or more harmful; doing wrong isn’t more painful than suffering it, so it’s more harmful—therefore worse.

- Second paradox: punishment benefits the soul. Of evils—poverty (estate), disease (body), injustice (soul)—injustice is worst; cures are trading, medicine, justice, the last being fairest. Best: never do wrong; second-best: be punished. Proper use of rhetoric: self-accusation to be healed; toward enemies, prefer they go unpunished (but harmless to oneself).

- Callicles enters, asserting nature vs convention: by nature “might is right”; society tames the strong; cites Pindar/Heracles; urges Socrates to drop excessive philosophy (fine for youth, ruinous in public life).

- Socrates, treating Callicles as an ideal critic, probes “natural justice”: is it rule of the stronger or the better? If identical, the many (being stronger) make equality and the shame of doing wrong “natural” too—setting up a reductio of Callicles’ thesis.
