- Framing: Plato’s dialogues have organic unity but multiple strands; avoid forcing a single thesis. Gorgias similarly begins with rhetoric but widens into a comprehensive ethical-political critique.

- Central opposition: true arts that care for body and soul vs sham “flatteries” or simulations. Rhetoric is one branch of flattery, opposed to disciplines that genuinely improve.

- Socratic “paradoxes” (to common opinion): 
  1) Doing injustice is worse than suffering it. 
  2) Having done wrong, it is better to be punished than to escape. 
  3) The bad do what they think best, not what they truly desire, since all desire is for the good.
  - Pleasure ≠ good: pleasure can coexist with pain and be as great or greater for the bad as for the good.

- Scope of critique: not only rhetoricians but poets, musicians, and statesmen are often mere flatterers; the true vs false is ultimately revealed in a postmortem judgment where rhetoric is useless.

- Dramatic structure and tones:
  - Gorgias: asked to define rhetoric; contradicts himself when unwilling to detach rhetoric from justice; treated respectfully but shown unable to ground his art.
  - Polus: impetuous defender claims rhetoric/despots wield great power; Socrates reduces rhetoric to “cookery,” denies real power, and leads Polus to concede the paradoxes’ implications.
  - Callicles: worldly cynic defends pleasure as good, “might is right,” and law as the weak’s conspiracy; resists, grows irritated, and partly withdraws. Socrates distinguishes higher statesmanship (improvement) from lower (flattery), exhorts Callicles to the higher, and closes with a myth of final judgment.

- Character sketches: Gorgias—celebrated, generous, vain, dialectically weak; Polus—talented, dazzled by power, yet educable; Callicles—ambitious materialist admiring strong leaders, hostile to philosophy, wielding rhetoric as power.

- Socrates: increasingly ironic and provoking, adapting his tone to opponents while relentlessly pressing the ethical core.
