- Socrates exploits Callicles’ earlier equation “better = superior = stronger” to a reductio: the many are stronger, so their egalitarian laws are “by nature” best. Callicles retreats: by “better/superior” he means the wiser—specifically, capable, courageous statesmen—not mere physical strength.

- Pressed to clarify “having more,” Socrates uses a physician-and-food case to show that being “better” does not entail larger personal consumption, but right authority/distribution. Callicles rejects material analogies (food, coats, shoes), insisting he means political superiority.

- Socrates introduces “ruling oneself” as temperance (self-mastery). Callicles derides temperance as slavish. His positive thesis: natural justice is unbounded desire and maximal gratification; the naturally superior (born to rule/tyrannize) should satisfy every appetite if they have the means. Conventional praise of temperance/justice is a conspiracy of the weak to restrain the strong.

- Socrates counters with Pythagorean/Orphic images:
  - Soma/sema: body as tomb; intemperate souls are “leaky vessels” endlessly filling and losing.
  - Two-lives parable: temperate man’s sound, full casks vs intemperate man’s leaky casks requiring ceaseless refilling—arguing order/sufficiency is happier.

- Callicles replies: a “filled” life is stone-like, without ongoing pleasure; happiness is continual inflow (ever-renewed desire and satisfaction). Socrates pushes toward a reductio by invoking base pleasures (itching/scratching), setting up the coming refutation of hedonism (pleasure ≠ good).
