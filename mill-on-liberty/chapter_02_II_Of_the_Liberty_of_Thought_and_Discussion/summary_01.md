- Mill shifts focus from state censorship to societal coercion: even when government mirrors public opinion, coercing belief is illegitimate. Suppressing any opinion—whether held by one against all—wrongs humanity by depriving present and future people of truth or of the clearer grasp of truth that comes from confronting error.
- He frames two cases of suppressed opinions: if true, we lose truth; if false, we lose the testing that sharpens truth. We can never be sure an opinion is false, and even if we were, suppression would still be harmful.
- Core claim: silencing discussion assumes infallibility. Individuals and ages are fallible; people typically outsource certainty to their “world” (party, church, class), ignoring that other “worlds” and eras hold contradictory views.
- Reply to the objection that authorities must act on convictions: yes, act—but do not forbid refutation. Rational assurance is justified only when views have faced open contestation.
- Human errors are corrigible through experience interpreted by discussion; facts need argumentative context. Wise judgment requires hearing all sides (devil’s advocate; even Newtonian science must remain challengeable).
- Certainty for fallible beings rests on continual openness to challenge; limiting “extreme” cases still presumes infallibility. Contemporary defenses of insulation appeal to social necessity rather than truth.
