- Lost pedagogical “contrivances” that forced engagement with opposition: medieval disputations (inferior to Socratic dialectic because premise from authority, not reason) still trained minds to know both sides. Modern education offers no substitute; most—even thinkers—cannot argue against antagonists. “Negative logic” (critique) is disparaged, yet indispensable for real knowledge; without it, few great thinkers arise outside math/physics. Hence we should welcome dissenters—they do for us, cheaply, what we would otherwise have to labor to simulate.

- Third, commonest case for protecting discussion: rival doctrines often each hold part of the truth. Popular views on non-sensible subjects are usually partial and one-sided; “heretical” views often surface the neglected remainder. Progress typically swaps one partial truth for another; one-sided advocates are useful to compel attention to missing truths. Example: Rousseau’s critique of artificial civilization restored vital truths (simplicity, corruption by social pretense) against Enlightenment one-sidedness.

- In practice, truth in public life emerges from reconciling opposites (e.g., order/progress, democracy/aristocracy, property/equality, cooperation/competition, liberty/discipline). Minority views merit encouragement because they represent neglected interests and keep majorities within reason.

- Reply to “some principles are the whole truth” (e.g., Christian morality): the New Testament presupposes prior morality, speaks in general/poetic terms, and was later supplemented into “theological morality” by the early Church and sects. While historically beneficial, this morality is incomplete and reactive (negative, ascetic, otherworldly, passive obedience, scant civic duty), with higher civic virtues and public obligation largely derived from Greco-Roman sources. These defects aren’t inherent to Christ’s sayings, which can harmonize with a comprehensive ethics.
