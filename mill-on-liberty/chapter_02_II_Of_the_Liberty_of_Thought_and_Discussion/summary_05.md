- In modern/protestant conditions, you cannot confine controversial writings to an elite; if teachers are to know what they ought, everything must be freely written and published. 
- Without free discussion, not only the reasons but the very meanings of doctrines decay: living convictions shrink to rote phrases. Doctrines are vivid while struggling; once they prevail or stall and become hereditary, controversy ceases, converts are rare, and the creed’s living power declines. Belief becomes torpid, “encrusting” the mind and blocking new convictions.
- Christianity exemplifies this: New Testament precepts (poverty, nonjudgment, charity, non‑resistance, no oaths, trust in providence) are verbally honored but practical conduct follows social custom; doctrines serve to attack adversaries or badge respectability, not guide life. Early Christians’ felt meaning powered expansion; modern Christianity’s limited spread reflects lost vitality. Even earnest believers often animate Calvin/Knox‑era distinctives more than Christ’s sayings, because sectarian points are challenged and thus kept alive.
- Proverbial “truths” likewise remain dead until painful experience; open argument would have made their meaning vivid earlier. The “deep slumber of a decided opinion” causes many errors.
- Unanimity on true doctrines is good, but it removes a vital aid to understanding. Educators should simulate opposition (Socratic dialectic; medieval disputation) to force grasp of meaning and evidence. Modern education lacks this; few even know both sides, and their replies to antagonists are weakest.
