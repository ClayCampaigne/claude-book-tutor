- Mill rebuts calls to limit free discussion in “extreme” cases: exempting any doctrine from challenge because it is “certain” still assumes infallibility. Allowing debate only on “doubtful” matters makes the majority judge of what’s doubtful, without hearing the other side.
- Modern defenses of restraint shift from truth to social utility (some beliefs are deemed indispensable to well-being). Mill argues this merely relocates the infallibility claim: usefulness is itself disputable and requires open debate; moreover, truth is integral to utility, so forbidding arguments about truth makes any “utility” debate unfair and effectively moot.
- He chooses the hardest cases—belief in God, a future life, and core moral doctrines—to stress the point. The vice is not being personally certain, but imposing that certainty on others by silencing defense. Calling views “immoral” or “impious” heightens the danger and historically led to persecuting the best people and ideas.
- Historical cautions: Socrates and Jesus were condemned by sincere contemporaries; even exemplary rulers like Marcus Aurelius persecuted Christianity from a sincere belief in social necessity. If he could err, none should claim authority to punish opinion.
- Reply to the “persecution is harmless to truth” view: even if truth survives, this treats truth-bearers unjustly and ungenerously.
