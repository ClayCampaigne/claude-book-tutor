- Social coercion most harms the orthodox majority: promising but timid minds spend their lives trying to square conscience and reason with orthodoxy instead of pursuing independent inquiry. Great thinking requires following reason wherever it leads; even a well-prepared thinker’s errors advance truth more than unexamined true beliefs. Freedom of thought is needed not only for geniuses but for average people to reach their capacities; “mental slavery” yields no intellectually active people.
- Historical proof: Europe’s great intellectual spurts followed breaks in authority—the Reformation, the late‑18th‑century Continental movement, and the brief Goethe/Fichte era in Germany. These impulses made modern Europe and are waning; a new start requires renewed mental freedom.
- Second division: even if received opinions are true, without open discussion they become “dead dogma.” Assent without understanding collapses under slight challenge or hardens into prejudice.
- Mathematics is exceptional (arguments all on one side). In science and especially in morals, religion, politics, and life, truth emerges from weighing opposing reasons. One must hear the strongest case from real advocates; knowing only one side is not knowing.
- Even if laypeople rely on experts, experts need free expression of objections to answer and test them. The Catholic solution (clergy study heresy, laity barred) breeds skilled advocates, not liberal minds, and is impractical in Protestant and modern contexts.
- Without discussion, not only grounds but meanings atrophy; doctrines persist as empty phrases.
