- Mill closes the Marcus Aurelius argument: unless one deems oneself wiser and more virtuous than Aurelius, one should not assume the joint infallibility needed to justify punishing opinion. Some, like Dr. Johnson, accept Aurelius’s logic and claim persecution is a harmless “ordeal” that truth survives and that usefully suppresses error; Mill condemns this as ungenerous to truth-bearers, effectively demanding martyrs as the normal “reward” for humanity’s benefactors (Locrian “halter” metaphor).

- He refutes the maxim that truth always triumphs over persecution: history shows repeated extirpations or centuries-long setbacks (pre-Luther reform attempts; Arnold of Brescia, Dolcino, Savonarola; Albigensians, Vaudois, Lollards, Hussites; later rooting out Protestantism in Spain, Italy, Flanders, Austria; England’s fate contingent on monarchs). Truth prevails only when it intermittently escapes suppression long enough to gain strength.

- Modern residues of legal persecution persist: a 21‑month sentence for blasphemous words (1857 Cornwall); atheists excluded from juries/evidence due to oath requirements. Mill calls this ignorant, self-defeating (admits liars, punishes honest avowers), a badge of hatred, and insulting to believers (as if only fear of hell ensures honesty).

- The greater threat is social stigma: for the non‑independent it functions like law, inducing concealment and discouraging propagation. This “intellectual pacification” preserves outward conformity at the cost of moral courage, producing conformists or “timeservers for truth,” narrowing discourse to small practicalities, and abandoning bold speculation. The harm falls most on the orthodox majority: minds are cowed by fear of heresy; promising intellects waste themselves reconciling reason with orthodoxy. Great thinking requires following reason wherever it leads.
