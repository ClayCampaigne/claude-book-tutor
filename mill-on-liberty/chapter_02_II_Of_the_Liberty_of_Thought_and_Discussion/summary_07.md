- Mill argues that many virtues (magnanimity, honor, civic duty) stem from Greek/Roman, not Christian, sources. Christ’s sayings are compatible with a comprehensive ethics but intentionally partial; the Church-built system omits essential elements. Seeking a complete moral code exclusively in Christianity is an error that, when used alone to form character, breeds a low, servile disposition unable to conceive “Supreme Goodness.” Other ethical sources must coexist with Christian ethics; diversity of opinions remains necessary. Protest is due when a partial truth claims to be the whole; even overreactions should be tolerated. Christians should acknowledge that much noble moral teaching has come from those outside or rejecting Christianity.

- Free discussion won’t erase sectarian one-sidedness and may inflame partisans, but it benefits calm bystanders. The great danger is quiet suppression of half-truths, not robust conflict; truth needs every side vigorously advocated and heard.

- Recap of four grounds for free opinion/expression: (1) the silenced view may be true; (2) false views often contain part of the truth; (3) unchallenged truths become prejudices; (4) doctrines’ meanings atrophy without contest.

- Against “only if temperate” restraints: boundaries are vague and effective criticism is always “offensive” to targets. The gravest polemical wrongs (sophistry, suppression, misstatement) are often in good faith and beyond lawful policing. Invective in practice advantages prevailing opinions and harms minorities most; worst is branding opponents immoral. If anything were to be discouraged, it should be vituperation against unpopular views (e.g., infidelity), though law should restrain neither. The true morality of discussion is case-by-case censure of bad faith and honoring candid, fair representation of opponents.
