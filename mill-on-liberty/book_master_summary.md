# Book Overview
Mill grounds a comprehensive defense of individual liberty in the harm principle: coercion is justified only to prevent harm to others. He traces political and social tyranny, champions free discussion and individuality, demarcates society’s jurisdiction from self-regarding conduct, and applies the doctrine to trade, vice, education, family law, and the state’s proper functions.

# Chapter Summaries
1. I. Introductory: Mill reframes liberty as setting limits to society’s power over adults, noting political and, deeper, social tyranny by majority opinion, and proposes the harm principle: coercion is justified only to prevent harm to others, grounding three basic freedoms—conscience/expression, self-regarding conduct, and voluntary association—exempting children and “backward” peoples, assigning responsibility for wrongful acts and clear omissions, and warning that expanding social power compels a principled barrier before defending liberty of discussion.

2. II. Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion: He defends unrestricted discussion against legal and social silencing because humans are fallible; suppression assumes infallibility and either robs us of truth or of the collision that vitalizes and secures it, turning beliefs into dead dogma; utility cannot be severed from truth; history (Socrates, Jesus, Christians under Aurelius) shows virtuous persecutors err; thus debate must remain open, with only unfair tactics morally checked, lest stigma pacify intellect and stunt education’s dialectical cultivation.

3. III. Of Individuality as One of the Elements of Well-Being: Extending from opinion to conduct, Mill argues for widest freedom in self-regarding “experiments in living,” since customs, though experiential, misfit diverse natures and, when followed unchosen, enfeeble judgment; trained, not repressed, impulses with strong conscience form character and public energy; conformity and status mimicry now dominate, marginalizing genius and valuable eccentricity—especially women—so society should prize difference to avert stagnation like China’s and retain Europe’s progressive motor.

4. IV. Of the Limits to the Authority of Society over the Individual: He locates society’s jurisdiction where conduct prejudicially affects others’ assignable interests—enforcing non-injury and fair sacrifice—while leaving self-regarding conduct to advice, esteem, and consequence; mere offense is not injury; only definite damage, risk, or duty-breach warrants censure or punishment, a bar that invalidates temperance prohibitions and Sabbatarian amusements bans, and counsels toleration of Mormon polygamy while securing exit freedom, relying on persuasion over a coercive civilizade.

5. V. Applications: Applying the maxims, Mill distinguishes competitive disappointments from wrongs, treats trade as a social act fit for anti-fraud, safety, and sanitation rules—not blanket prohibitions that mainly restrain buyers—permits preventive policing against imminent crime, secures poison access with labels and “preappointed evidence,” resists vice-prohibition while targeting other-harm (e.g., drunken violence), upholds retractable contracts (not self-enslavement), reforms marriage and mandates minimally dogma-free education, and prefers decentralized, empowering state aid over capacity-dwarfing bureaucracy.

# Key Themes
- Harm principle: Coercion is justified only to prevent harm to others; self-regarding conduct is inviolable.
- Social tyranny: Majority opinion and custom coerce more pervasively than law; erect moral barriers.
- Free discussion: Open contest corrects fallibility, prevents “dead dogma,” and serves truth and utility.
- Individuality/experiments: Self-chosen lives cultivate character, energy, creativity, and social progress.
- Offense vs injury: Offense, distaste, and competition’s disappointments are not grounds for coercion.
- Regulation vs prohibition: Trade merits anti-fraud and safety rules; blanket bans mostly violate buyers’ liberty.
- Family and education: Equality in marriage; compulsory, plural, non-dogmatic education to a minimum standard.
- State action: Prefer aid, information, and decentralization; avoid bureaucracy that dwarfs citizens’ capacities.
