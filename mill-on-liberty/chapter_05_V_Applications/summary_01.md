- Mill opens “Applications” by restating the Essay’s two maxims: (1) self-regarding conduct is not accountable to society (only advice/avoidance are justified); (2) conduct harming others is accountable and may merit social or legal penalties. The chapter offers specimen applications to clarify their limits and balance.
- Harm to others does not always justify interference: competitive success (exams, professions, preferences) inevitably disappoints others, yet pursuing such legitimate aims should be left free; only fraud, treachery, or force warrant intervention.
- Trade is a social act and within society’s jurisdiction. Free Trade rests on effectiveness (cheapness/quality via free producer/consumer choice), not on the liberty principle. Many trade controls (anti-fraud, sanitation, worker safety) are legitimate; commodity prohibitions (e.g., Maine Law, opium bans, poison sales) primarily infringe buyers’ liberty.
- Preventive policing is legitimate but prone to abuse. Clear, imminent crime may be stopped; otherwise, prefer warning over coercion (unsafe bridge analogy), except for incompetence (child, delirium).
- For poisons: allow access with minimal liberty infringement—labeling and Bentham’s “preappointed evidence” (record buyer identity, time, quantity, purpose; witness presence without prescription) to deter criminal misuse.
- Self-regarding misconduct can trigger tailored restraints when it reliably leads to other-harm: e.g., special penalties for those who commit violence while drunk; enforce legal duties (child support) even via compulsory labor; prohibit public indecency as an offense against others.
- Counseling self-regarding acts should generally be as free as the acts themselves. Boundary case: occupations that profit by promoting contested self-regarding harms (pimps, gambling-house keepers). Arguments divide between consistency/toleration and excluding biased, pecuniary solicitations deemed contrary to public weal.
