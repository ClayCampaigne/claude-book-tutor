- Misplaced liberty: Freedom in self-regarding matters does not justify unchecked power over others. The State must vigilantly oversee powers it permits, especially in families.
- Wives: Remedy husbands’ near-despotism by granting wives equal rights and legal protection; defenders of the status quo appeal to power, not liberty.
- Children and education:
  - Compulsory education up to a minimum standard is a State duty; parents morally owe both material support and mental training. If they fail, the State should enforce education at the parent’s expense where possible.
  - Distinguish enforcement from provision: the State should compel results, not monopolize teaching. Prefer diverse, competing schools; State schools only as one option or a temporary necessity in backward societies. Offer fee aid to the poor.
  - Enforcement mechanism: universal public examinations from early age (e.g., initial literacy), annual retesting with widening scope; fines for noncompliant parents and mandatory schooling at their expense.
  - Content safeguards: exams beyond instrumental skills confined to facts/positive science; on disputed topics test knowledge of positions/grounds, not truth. Higher examinations entirely voluntary; no exclusion from professions for “deficiency.” Certificates confer only reputational weight.
- Broader parental responsibility and population:
  - Procreating without reasonable prospects of a decent life is a moral crime against the child; in overpopulated contexts, large families harm laborers by depressing wages.
  - Laws requiring means to support a family before marriage are within legitimate State power (expediency depends on local conditions) as prohibitions of harmful acts.
- Beyond liberty: New class of questions on State “helping” rather than restraining. Objections to such interference (without liberty infringement):
  1) Individuals best conduct their own business (political economy).
  2) Even if government might do it better, leaving tasks to individuals/localities/juries/voluntary associations develops civic capacities essential to free constitutions, preserves individuality/diversity, and fosters varied experimentation. The State should collate and disseminate lessons, not monopolize experiments.
