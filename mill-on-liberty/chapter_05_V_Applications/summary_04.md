- Developmental case for non-state action: Local self-government, juries, and voluntary associations cultivate habits of managing joint interests and acting from public motives—capacities essential to establishing and preserving free constitutions. Local liberties provide the base; centralized uniformity stifles individuality and experimentation.
- State’s proper role: Be a central repository and diffuser of lessons from many diverse experiments, enabling each “experimentalist” to learn from others, rather than monopolizing experiments.
- Third (strongest) reason to limit state interference: every added function expands governmental patronage and dependence, risking a bureaucracy that commands hopes and fears. Even efficient, merit-selected administrations can concentrate talent and power, reducing real freedom to a name.
  - Competitive examinations: the objection that civil service won’t attract the “highest talents” is actually a safety-valve; drawing all top ability into government would dangerously centralize intelligence and ambition.
  - Bureaucratic dominance breeds routine or faddishness, and becomes uncheckable without equally able critics outside. Hence society needs non-state arenas that form practical ability.
  - Illustrations: Russia’s bureaucracy can tacitly veto reforms; revolutions that merely swap heads leave bureaucratic rule intact. Peoples used to self-management (e.g., Americans in civil affairs; French with improvised leadership) resist bureaucratic domination.
- Practical principle: maximal dissemination of power consistent with efficiency; maximal centralization and diffusion of information.
  - Model: Local officers handle local business; a central superintendence aggregates knowledge, advises, and compels compliance only with legislated rules; discretion otherwise remains local and electorally accountable.
  - Example: Poor Law Board’s stronger powers justified exceptionally to prevent pauperism spilling across localities; such coercion is improper for purely local interests.
- Bottom line: Government should aid, inform, and stimulate individual/associational activity, not replace it. States that dwarf citizens for administrative neatness ultimately achieve little; machinery without developed individuals lacks vital power.
