- Boundary case continued: Should occupations that profit from others’ self-regarding vices (pimps, gambling-house keepers) be allowed? Toleration argues consistency and equal freedom to persuade; restriction argues excluding biased, pecuniary solicitations deemed contrary to public weal. Mill sees force on both sides, noting partial suppression (forcing secrecy) may reduce exposure, but he won’t affirm punishing accessories while principals go free.

- Do not generalize this to ordinary commerce: many goods can be abused, but sellers’ interests don’t justify bans like the Maine Law. Alcohol sellers are necessary for legitimate uses; their incentive to promote excess is a real harm that warrants targeted restrictions and guarantees, not prohibition.

- Tax policy: Taxes solely to deter consumption are tantamount to prohibition and unjustified unless prohibition is. However, since revenue is necessary (often via indirect taxes), the State should tax items consumers can best spare—preferably those harmful beyond moderate use. Thus, taxing stimulants up to revenue-maximizing levels is approved if the revenue is needed.

- Licensing/retail controls: Justified for policing—limit on-premise sales to respectable licensees, regulate hours, revoke licenses for disturbances or criminal rendezvous. Not justified: limiting outlet numbers to raise difficulty/temptation—this is paternalism inconsistent with governing free adults.

- Voluntary associations and contracts: Consenting parties may bind themselves, but extreme self-enslavement contracts are void because alienating liberty defeats the very rationale for liberty. Many non-pecuniary engagements should allow retractation or mutual release.

- On Humboldt’s view (time-limited personal-service contracts; marriage dissoluble at will): Mill adds reliance and third-party interests (especially children) create serious moral, though not always legal, obligations that must weigh in decisions.

- Misplaced liberty: One’s liberty in self-regarding matters does not extend to acting for others under the guise that their affairs are one’s own. The State must vigilantly oversee powers over others, notably within families. Husbands’ near-despotic power over wives should end by granting wives equal rights and legal protection; defenders of the status quo appeal to power, not liberty.
