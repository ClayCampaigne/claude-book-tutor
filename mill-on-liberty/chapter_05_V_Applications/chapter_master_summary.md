<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Mill’s “Applications” restates his two maxims and tests their limits: (1) purely self-regarding conduct is not accountable to society (only advice or avoidance are proper responses); (2) conduct that harms others is accountable and may rightly incur social or legal penalties. Yet “harm to others” does not license every interference: disappointments caused by competition in exams, professions, or preferences are not wrongs; only fraud, treachery, or force justify restraint.

Trade is a social act and falls under social control. Free trade is defended on effectiveness, not the liberty principle; many regulations (anti-fraud, sanitation, worker safety) are proper, while blanket commodity prohibitions (Maine Law, opium bans) chiefly violate buyers’ liberty. Preventive policing is legitimate against clear, imminent crime; otherwise, prefer warning to coercion (unsafe-bridge case), except where competence is lacking (children, the delirious). Poisons should be accessible with minimal interference—truthful labels and Benthamite “preappointed evidence” (recorded, witnessed sales) to deter crime.

Self-regarding vices warrant tailored restraints only when they reliably eventuate in other-harm: e.g., special penalties for violence committed in drink; enforcing legal duties like child support, even by compulsory labor; proscribing public indecency as an offense to others. Counseling self-regarding acts should be as free as the acts; boundary call: occupations profiting from others’ vices (pimps, gambling-house keepers). Mill sees force on both sides and will not punish accessories while principals go free. Ordinary commerce should not be restricted on abuse-possibility alone. For alcohol, prohibition and deterrent taxes are unjustified; needed revenue may be raised by taxing stimulants up to the revenue-maximizing point. Legitimate retail controls are policing measures (respectable licensees, hours, revocation for disorder), not scarcity-by-design.

Voluntary associations and contracts stand, but alienating one’s liberty (self-enslavement) is void; many engagements should allow retractation. Marriage raises reliance and third-party (children’s) interests. Liberty in self-regard does not excuse power over others; the state must oversee domestic authority, ending husbands’ near-despotism by equal rights and legal protection. Education may be made compulsory to a minimum standard, enforced by universal examinations, fines, and schooling at parental expense if needed; provision should remain plural and competitive, with state schools as options and aid for the poor; testing should avoid dogma.

Beyond restraint, Mill weighs state “help.” Even where liberty is untouched, interference risks: individuals often know their own business best; civic capacities and individuality grow when tasks are left to persons, localities, juries, and associations; and, strongest, expanding functions breeds patronage and bureaucratic domination. A free polity disperses power while centralizing and diffusing information: local bodies manage local affairs under light central superintendence that collects lessons and enforces only clear rules (as exceptionally in the Poor Law). Government should aid, inform, and stimulate, not supplant; states that dwarf citizens, however efficient their machinery, achieve little of worth.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Mill opens “Applications” by restating the Essay’s two maxims: (1) self-regarding conduct is not accountable to society (only advice/avoidance are justified); (2) conduct harming others is accountable and may merit social or legal penalties. The chapter offers specimen applications to clarify their limits and balance.
- Harm to others does not always justify interference: competitive success (exams, professions, preferences) inevitably disappoints others, yet pursuing such legitimate aims should be left free; only fraud, treachery, or force warrant intervention.
- Trade is a social act and within society’s jurisdiction. Free Trade rests on effectiveness (cheapness/quality via free producer/consumer choice), not on the liberty principle. Many trade controls (anti-fraud, sanitation, worker safety) are legitimate; commodity prohibitions (e.g., Maine Law, opium bans, poison sales) primarily infringe buyers’ liberty.
- Preventive policing is legitimate but prone to abuse. Clear, imminent crime may be stopped; otherwise, prefer warning over coercion (unsafe bridge analogy), except for incompetence (child, delirium).
- For poisons: allow access with minimal liberty infringement—labeling and Bentham’s “preappointed evidence” (record buyer identity, time, quantity, purpose; witness presence without prescription) to deter criminal misuse.
- Self-regarding misconduct can trigger tailored restraints when it reliably leads to other-harm: e.g., special penalties for those who commit violence while drunk; enforce legal duties (child support) even via compulsory labor; prohibit public indecency as an offense against others.
- Counseling self-regarding acts should generally be as free as the acts themselves. Boundary case: occupations that profit by promoting contested self-regarding harms (pimps, gambling-house keepers). Arguments divide between consistency/toleration and excluding biased, pecuniary solicitations deemed contrary to public weal.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Boundary case continued: Should occupations that profit from others’ self-regarding vices (pimps, gambling-house keepers) be allowed? Toleration argues consistency and equal freedom to persuade; restriction argues excluding biased, pecuniary solicitations deemed contrary to public weal. Mill sees force on both sides, noting partial suppression (forcing secrecy) may reduce exposure, but he won’t affirm punishing accessories while principals go free.

- Do not generalize this to ordinary commerce: many goods can be abused, but sellers’ interests don’t justify bans like the Maine Law. Alcohol sellers are necessary for legitimate uses; their incentive to promote excess is a real harm that warrants targeted restrictions and guarantees, not prohibition.

- Tax policy: Taxes solely to deter consumption are tantamount to prohibition and unjustified unless prohibition is. However, since revenue is necessary (often via indirect taxes), the State should tax items consumers can best spare—preferably those harmful beyond moderate use. Thus, taxing stimulants up to revenue-maximizing levels is approved if the revenue is needed.

- Licensing/retail controls: Justified for policing—limit on-premise sales to respectable licensees, regulate hours, revoke licenses for disturbances or criminal rendezvous. Not justified: limiting outlet numbers to raise difficulty/temptation—this is paternalism inconsistent with governing free adults.

- Voluntary associations and contracts: Consenting parties may bind themselves, but extreme self-enslavement contracts are void because alienating liberty defeats the very rationale for liberty. Many non-pecuniary engagements should allow retractation or mutual release.

- On Humboldt’s view (time-limited personal-service contracts; marriage dissoluble at will): Mill adds reliance and third-party interests (especially children) create serious moral, though not always legal, obligations that must weigh in decisions.

- Misplaced liberty: One’s liberty in self-regarding matters does not extend to acting for others under the guise that their affairs are one’s own. The State must vigilantly oversee powers over others, notably within families. Husbands’ near-despotic power over wives should end by granting wives equal rights and legal protection; defenders of the status quo appeal to power, not liberty.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Misplaced liberty: Freedom in self-regarding matters does not justify unchecked power over others. The State must vigilantly oversee powers it permits, especially in families.
- Wives: Remedy husbands’ near-despotism by granting wives equal rights and legal protection; defenders of the status quo appeal to power, not liberty.
- Children and education:
  - Compulsory education up to a minimum standard is a State duty; parents morally owe both material support and mental training. If they fail, the State should enforce education at the parent’s expense where possible.
  - Distinguish enforcement from provision: the State should compel results, not monopolize teaching. Prefer diverse, competing schools; State schools only as one option or a temporary necessity in backward societies. Offer fee aid to the poor.
  - Enforcement mechanism: universal public examinations from early age (e.g., initial literacy), annual retesting with widening scope; fines for noncompliant parents and mandatory schooling at their expense.
  - Content safeguards: exams beyond instrumental skills confined to facts/positive science; on disputed topics test knowledge of positions/grounds, not truth. Higher examinations entirely voluntary; no exclusion from professions for “deficiency.” Certificates confer only reputational weight.
- Broader parental responsibility and population:
  - Procreating without reasonable prospects of a decent life is a moral crime against the child; in overpopulated contexts, large families harm laborers by depressing wages.
  - Laws requiring means to support a family before marriage are within legitimate State power (expediency depends on local conditions) as prohibitions of harmful acts.
- Beyond liberty: New class of questions on State “helping” rather than restraining. Objections to such interference (without liberty infringement):
  1) Individuals best conduct their own business (political economy).
  2) Even if government might do it better, leaving tasks to individuals/localities/juries/voluntary associations develops civic capacities essential to free constitutions, preserves individuality/diversity, and fosters varied experimentation. The State should collate and disseminate lessons, not monopolize experiments.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Developmental case for non-state action: Local self-government, juries, and voluntary associations cultivate habits of managing joint interests and acting from public motives—capacities essential to establishing and preserving free constitutions. Local liberties provide the base; centralized uniformity stifles individuality and experimentation.
- State’s proper role: Be a central repository and diffuser of lessons from many diverse experiments, enabling each “experimentalist” to learn from others, rather than monopolizing experiments.
- Third (strongest) reason to limit state interference: every added function expands governmental patronage and dependence, risking a bureaucracy that commands hopes and fears. Even efficient, merit-selected administrations can concentrate talent and power, reducing real freedom to a name.
  - Competitive examinations: the objection that civil service won’t attract the “highest talents” is actually a safety-valve; drawing all top ability into government would dangerously centralize intelligence and ambition.
  - Bureaucratic dominance breeds routine or faddishness, and becomes uncheckable without equally able critics outside. Hence society needs non-state arenas that form practical ability.
  - Illustrations: Russia’s bureaucracy can tacitly veto reforms; revolutions that merely swap heads leave bureaucratic rule intact. Peoples used to self-management (e.g., Americans in civil affairs; French with improvised leadership) resist bureaucratic domination.
- Practical principle: maximal dissemination of power consistent with efficiency; maximal centralization and diffusion of information.
  - Model: Local officers handle local business; a central superintendence aggregates knowledge, advises, and compels compliance only with legislated rules; discretion otherwise remains local and electorally accountable.
  - Example: Poor Law Board’s stronger powers justified exceptionally to prevent pauperism spilling across localities; such coercion is improper for purely local interests.
- Bottom line: Government should aid, inform, and stimulate individual/associational activity, not replace it. States that dwarf citizens for administrative neatness ultimately achieve little; machinery without developed individuals lacks vital power.
