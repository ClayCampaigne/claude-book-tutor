<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Mill opens by redefining the question of liberty as the proper limits of society’s authority over the individual. Historically, “liberty” meant safeguards against tyrannical rulers—either entrenched rights justifying resistance or constitutional checks requiring community consent. With representative government, many assumed rulers and ruled were the same, so restraint seemed needless. Experience proved otherwise: “self-government” is typically the rule of a majority—or the most active part—over minorities. Tyranny can be social as well as political, enforced by opinion and custom through stigma and exclusion, penetrating life more deeply than law. Hence protection must extend not only against magistrates but also against collective sentiment. Yet societies usually decide what to regulate by unexamined preferences and inherited customs—mistaking habit for nature. Moral rules often express class interest, prejudice, or servility to power or deity rather than reasoned concern for social well-being; even enlightened reformers tend to contest particular aversions, not society’s title to impose them. Religious liberty is the rare principled exception, won largely by a balance of sects and still partial.

Against this background Mill proposes a “very simple principle”: society may coerce individuals (by law or opinion) only to prevent harm to others, never for their own physical or moral good. Adults are sovereign over their own body and mind; this excludes children and “backward” peoples not yet improvable by free discussion. The doctrine rests on utility broadly understood—human progress—rather than abstract right. Responsibility covers wrongful acts and, in clear cases, harmful omissions and civic duties (e.g., testimony, defense, rescue). From this follow three essential liberties: freedom of conscience and its near-inseparable expression; liberty of tastes and life-plans; and freedom of voluntary association among consenting adults. A society lacking these is not free, and humanity gains more from tolerated self-direction than enforced conformity. Despite this, modern opinion often presses hardest on self-regarding conduct—intensified by hierarchical religion, Puritanism, and even secular creeds—while, in England, distrust of government leaves opinion the chief coercive force. With social power expanding, only a firm moral barrier can prevent encroachment. Mill proceeds to defend, first, liberty of thought and discussion.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Mill’s subject is civil/social liberty: defining the legitimate limits of society’s power over the individual.
- Historically, “liberty” meant protection from rulers’ tyranny. Two safeguards emerged: (1) recognized rights/immunities justifying resistance if violated; (2) constitutional checks requiring consent of the community or its representatives.
- With the rise of elective, accountable government, many assumed rulers identified with the people, so limiting power seemed less necessary.
- Experience with democratic republics revealed “self-government” is really rule by the majority or the most active part over others; thus, tyranny of the majority is a real danger.
- Tyranny can be social, not just political: prevailing opinion and feeling can enforce conformity through non-legal sanctions, deeply invading life and suppressing individuality.
- Therefore, protection is needed not only against magistrates but also against collective opinion; the central problem is where to draw the line between individual independence and social control.
- Some rules must exist (law and opinion), but deciding which remains unresolved and varies across times and places. Custom is mistaken for nature; people rely on unreasoned preferences.
- Moral rules often reflect class interests, prejudices, self/anti-social feelings, and servility to rulers or gods more than reasoned social interest; social likings largely set enforced norms, a condition seldom challenged in principle even by advanced thinkers.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Social rules have often reflected servility to rulers or gods, generating sincere but misguided moral abhorrence (e.g., persecution of heretics). Society’s likes/dislikes—often rooted in sympathies and antipathies rather than reasoned social interest—have largely set enforced norms, and even advanced thinkers typically tried to change specific sentiments rather than challenge society’s right to impose them. The notable principled exception is religious liberty, won largely because rival sects stalemated; even then, toleration is partial and contingent on indifference.
- In England, law interferes less than opinion, partly due to lingering distrust of government. Without a recognized principle, people back or oppose state intervention by preference, making both overreach and underreach common.
- Mill’s “very simple principle” (harm principle): society (by law or opinion) may compel individuals only to prevent harm to others, not for their own good (physical or moral). Adults are sovereign over their own body and mind; this excludes children and “backward” societies not yet capable of improvement by free discussion. The doctrine rests on utility broadly conceived (progressive human interests), not abstract right.
- Accountability extends to harmful actions and, cautiously, harmful inaction; positive duties (e.g., testify, share in common defense, rescue in clear cases) may be compelled.
- The sphere of liberty: (1) freedom of conscience, thought, and near-inseparable expression; (2) liberty of tastes and life-plans; (3) freedom of voluntary association among consenting adults. A society lacking these is not free. True freedom is pursuing one’s own good without depriving or impeding others; mankind benefits more from tolerated self-direction than enforced conformity.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Extends the harm principle to two concrete liberties beyond thought:  
  - Liberty of tastes and pursuits—each may shape life to suit their character and bear the consequences, without interference so long as no harm to others occurs, even if others deem the conduct foolish or wrong.  
  - Liberty of association—free combination for any non-harmful purpose by consenting, undeceived adults of full age.
- A society lacking these is not free; complete freedom requires these liberties be absolute and unqualified. True freedom is pursuing one’s own good without depriving or impeding others; individuals are proper guardians of their own bodily, mental, and spiritual health. Humanity gains more by tolerating self-direction than enforcing conformity.
- Despite seeming obvious, prevailing opinion/practice resists this. Ancient small republics plausibly regulated private conduct for survival; but in modern large states, while church–state separation reduced legal intrusion, moral repression by opinion intensified—often stronger in self-regarding matters—driven by hierarchical religion, Puritanism, and even secular systems (e.g., Comte’s positivism) seeking social despotism.
- Societal power and propensity to impose norms are growing; without a strong moral barrier, encroachment will increase.
- Mill will first argue for Liberty of Thought (inseparable from speech/press), whose underappreciated grounds generalize to the whole doctrine.
