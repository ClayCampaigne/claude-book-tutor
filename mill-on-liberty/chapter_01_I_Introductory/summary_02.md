- Social rules have often reflected servility to rulers or gods, generating sincere but misguided moral abhorrence (e.g., persecution of heretics). Society’s likes/dislikes—often rooted in sympathies and antipathies rather than reasoned social interest—have largely set enforced norms, and even advanced thinkers typically tried to change specific sentiments rather than challenge society’s right to impose them. The notable principled exception is religious liberty, won largely because rival sects stalemated; even then, toleration is partial and contingent on indifference.
- In England, law interferes less than opinion, partly due to lingering distrust of government. Without a recognized principle, people back or oppose state intervention by preference, making both overreach and underreach common.
- Mill’s “very simple principle” (harm principle): society (by law or opinion) may compel individuals only to prevent harm to others, not for their own good (physical or moral). Adults are sovereign over their own body and mind; this excludes children and “backward” societies not yet capable of improvement by free discussion. The doctrine rests on utility broadly conceived (progressive human interests), not abstract right.
- Accountability extends to harmful actions and, cautiously, harmful inaction; positive duties (e.g., testify, share in common defense, rescue in clear cases) may be compelled.
- The sphere of liberty: (1) freedom of conscience, thought, and near-inseparable expression; (2) liberty of tastes and life-plans; (3) freedom of voluntary association among consenting adults. A society lacking these is not free. True freedom is pursuing one’s own good without depriving or impeding others; mankind benefits more from tolerated self-direction than enforced conformity.
