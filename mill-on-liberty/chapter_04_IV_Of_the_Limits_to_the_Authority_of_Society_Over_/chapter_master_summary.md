<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Mill asks where personal sovereignty ends and social authority begins, and answers: by allocating spheres according to whose interests are chiefly implicated. Because individuals benefit from society, they owe two enforceable duties—non-injury to others’ rights-based interests, and a fair share of the sacrifices needed to defend the community. Society’s jurisdiction properly begins when conduct prejudicially affects others’ interests; it has no standing where conduct concerns only competent adults themselves. In self-regarding matters there should be complete legal and social freedom to act and to bear the consequences. After maturity, self-regarding virtues should be promoted by education, persuasion, and exhortation, not coercion; legitimate responses are the natural, non-punitive consequences of opinion (loss of esteem, avoidance, cautioning others, preferring others in optional favors), alongside assistance aimed at improvement. Self-regarding faults display folly, not wickedness, unless they breach duties to others; other-regarding wrongs—and the dispositions that produce them—merit moral reprobation and, in grave cases, punishment.

Answering calls to suppress self-regarding vices, Mill concedes self-harm can burden others. But once a distinct, assignable duty is violated, the case exits the self-regarding sphere and may be censured or punished—for the breach, not the vice (e.g., extravagance ending in unpaid debts; intemperance that neglects family; drunkenness on duty). Where there is definite damage or definite risk to others, morality or law may apply; where harm is merely contingent and no specific duty is violated, liberty should prevail.

Majorities are prone to mistake offense for injury and to impose their tastes as law, aided by moralists who sanctify intuition. Hence the only consistent safeguard is a strict bar on interference in self-regarding conduct. Mill applies this to temperance laws that effectively ban use, Sabbatarian restrictions on amusements (“Deorum injuriae Diis curae”), and Puritan or democratic attempts to police pleasures or incomes. On Mormon polygamy, he condemns the practice as illiberal yet deems persecution tyrannical so long as the community commits no external aggression and allows full freedom to leave. Civilization must rely on persuasion, not a coercive “civilizade”; if it cannot prevail without force, it is already degenerate.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Mill asks where individual sovereignty ends and social authority begins: allocate spheres by whose interests are chiefly implicated.
- Because we benefit from society, we owe: (1) non-injury to others’ rights-based interests; (2) a fair, equitable share of efforts/sacrifices to defend society. These may be enforced by law; opinion may also censure inconsiderate but non-rights-violating acts.
- Society’s jurisdiction starts when conduct prejudicially affects others’ interests; it has no standing where conduct concerns only competent adults themselves. In such self-regarding matters there should be complete legal and social freedom to act and bear the consequences.
- After maturity, self-regarding virtues must be promoted by education, persuasion, and exhortation—not coercion. Each person is the best judge of their own good; social interference rests on fallible general presumptions.
- Legitimate social responses to self-regarding faults are natural, non-punitive consequences (loss of esteem, avoidance, cautioning others, preferring others in optional favors), not organized punishment; assistance aimed at improvement remains appropriate.
- Self-regarding faults show folly, not wickedness, unless they breach duties to others. Other-regarding wrongs—and the dispositions that produce them (cruelty, envy, pleonexia, etc.)—merit moral reprobation and, in grave cases, punishment.
- This distinction guides reactions: pity or nonassociation for self-harm; punitive measures when others are harmed.
- Mill anticipates objections: self-injury harms dependents and public resources, sets bad examples, and some adults are unfit like children—hence calls to suppress vices by law and organized opinion—setting up the debate to follow.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Replying to calls to suppress “self-regarding” vices, Mill concedes self-harm can burden others. But once a distinct, assignable duty to others is breached, the case exits the self-regarding sphere and becomes rightly censurable/punishable—for the breach, not the vice. Examples: extravagance leading to unpaid debts; intemperance making one unable to support/educate a family; being drunk on duty (soldier/policeman). Causing family grief merits reproach as failure of consideration, even if the underlying habit isn’t itself vicious.
- The line: where there is definite damage or definite risk to others/the public, morality or law may apply; where harm is merely contingent/constructive and no specific duty is violated, liberty should prevail for the greater good of freedom.
- Society already has strong, proper means—education, formative circumstances, received opinion, and natural social penalties—to raise rational adults; if many remain unfit, that reflects its failure. Coercion undermines these means and breeds defiant backlash (e.g., Restoration grossness after Puritan intolerance).
- “Bad example” in self-harm likely deters by displaying its painful consequences.
- Majorities are prone to err in self-regarding matters, imposing their tastes and mistaking offense for injury; tastes are as private as opinions.
- Moralists abet this by sanctifying intuition; publics rarely self-limit censorship. Illustrations: Muslim bans on pork eating; Spain’s suppression of non-Catholic worship and revulsion at married clergy—showing the inconsistency and persecutory logic of policing personal conduct.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Spain and Southern Europe: Non-Catholic worship is illegal in Spain; a married clergy is widely deemed indecent. Mill argues that if society may coerce purely personal conduct, it must, on the same logic, enforce these sincere majority sentiments—unless we adopt the persecutor’s double standard (“we may persecute because we are right”). Hence the only consistent safeguard is a strict bar on interference in self-regarding matters.

- Puritan/majoritarian moralism: Historical efforts to suppress amusements (music, dancing, theatre) show how a dominant sect could regulate others’ pleasures. Democratic envy can function as informal sumptuary law; with socialist diffusion, stigma could attach to wealth or income not from manual labor. Worker majorities sometimes coerce equal wages and suppress superior earnings—illustrating how “public jurisdiction over private concerns” licenses class tyranny.

- Temperance (Maine Law): Prohibiting sale effectively bans use, targeting consumers’ liberty. The Alliance’s “social rights” (security, equality, moral/intellectual development) would let anyone demand the state make others act “as they ought,” justifying limitless coercion, even of speech.

- Sabbatarianism: Law may coordinate general rest (to prevent some forcing others to work), but not restrict leisure or amusements; religious offense is no valid ground (“Deorum injuriae Diis curae”).

- Mormonism: Persecution reveals enduring intolerance. Mill condemns polygamy—not as self-regarding—but as a direct violation of liberty, chaining women by abolishing reciprocal obligation.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Mill recounts persecution of Mormons (mob killings, mass expulsion) and current calls to coerce them into conformity—driven chiefly by outrage at polygamy. He notes the hypocrisy that practices tolerated abroad provoke “unquenchable animosity” when done by English-speaking quasi-Christians.
- He strongly condemns polygamy as contrary to liberty, since it removes reciprocal obligation and entrenches women’s subordination. Yet he observes many women may voluntarily choose it under prevailing norms that make marriage paramount, sometimes preferring polygamy to no marriage.
- Given that Mormons do not ask others to recognize their unions or exempt adherents from local laws, and have withdrawn to a remote, self-made settlement, preventing them from living under their own laws would be mere tyranny—provided two conditions hold: they commit no external aggression and they allow any dissenter full freedom to leave.
- He rejects a proposed “civilizade”: no community has a right to force another to be civilized unless the injured parties invite help. Legitimate measures are persuasion and domestic counter-advocacy, not silencing. If civilization needs coercion to prevail over “barbarism,” it is already degenerate and deserves renewal by stronger forces.
