- Mill recounts persecution of Mormons (mob killings, mass expulsion) and current calls to coerce them into conformity—driven chiefly by outrage at polygamy. He notes the hypocrisy that practices tolerated abroad provoke “unquenchable animosity” when done by English-speaking quasi-Christians.
- He strongly condemns polygamy as contrary to liberty, since it removes reciprocal obligation and entrenches women’s subordination. Yet he observes many women may voluntarily choose it under prevailing norms that make marriage paramount, sometimes preferring polygamy to no marriage.
- Given that Mormons do not ask others to recognize their unions or exempt adherents from local laws, and have withdrawn to a remote, self-made settlement, preventing them from living under their own laws would be mere tyranny—provided two conditions hold: they commit no external aggression and they allow any dissenter full freedom to leave.
- He rejects a proposed “civilizade”: no community has a right to force another to be civilized unless the injured parties invite help. Legitimate measures are persuasion and domestic counter-advocacy, not silencing. If civilization needs coercion to prevail over “barbarism,” it is already degenerate and deserves renewal by stronger forces.
