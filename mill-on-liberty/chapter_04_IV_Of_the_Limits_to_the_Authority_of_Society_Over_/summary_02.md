- Replying to calls to suppress “self-regarding” vices, Mill concedes self-harm can burden others. But once a distinct, assignable duty to others is breached, the case exits the self-regarding sphere and becomes rightly censurable/punishable—for the breach, not the vice. Examples: extravagance leading to unpaid debts; intemperance making one unable to support/educate a family; being drunk on duty (soldier/policeman). Causing family grief merits reproach as failure of consideration, even if the underlying habit isn’t itself vicious.
- The line: where there is definite damage or definite risk to others/the public, morality or law may apply; where harm is merely contingent/constructive and no specific duty is violated, liberty should prevail for the greater good of freedom.
- Society already has strong, proper means—education, formative circumstances, received opinion, and natural social penalties—to raise rational adults; if many remain unfit, that reflects its failure. Coercion undermines these means and breeds defiant backlash (e.g., Restoration grossness after Puritan intolerance).
- “Bad example” in self-harm likely deters by displaying its painful consequences.
- Majorities are prone to err in self-regarding matters, imposing their tastes and mistaking offense for injury; tastes are as private as opinions.
- Moralists abet this by sanctifying intuition; publics rarely self-limit censorship. Illustrations: Muslim bans on pork eating; Spain’s suppression of non-Catholic worship and revulsion at married clergy—showing the inconsistency and persecutory logic of policing personal conduct.
