- Spain and Southern Europe: Non-Catholic worship is illegal in Spain; a married clergy is widely deemed indecent. Mill argues that if society may coerce purely personal conduct, it must, on the same logic, enforce these sincere majority sentiments—unless we adopt the persecutor’s double standard (“we may persecute because we are right”). Hence the only consistent safeguard is a strict bar on interference in self-regarding matters.

- Puritan/majoritarian moralism: Historical efforts to suppress amusements (music, dancing, theatre) show how a dominant sect could regulate others’ pleasures. Democratic envy can function as informal sumptuary law; with socialist diffusion, stigma could attach to wealth or income not from manual labor. Worker majorities sometimes coerce equal wages and suppress superior earnings—illustrating how “public jurisdiction over private concerns” licenses class tyranny.

- Temperance (Maine Law): Prohibiting sale effectively bans use, targeting consumers’ liberty. The Alliance’s “social rights” (security, equality, moral/intellectual development) would let anyone demand the state make others act “as they ought,” justifying limitless coercion, even of speech.

- Sabbatarianism: Law may coordinate general rest (to prevent some forcing others to work), but not restrict leisure or amusements; religious offense is no valid ground (“Deorum injuriae Diis curae”).

- Mormonism: Persecution reveals enduring intolerance. Mill condemns polygamy—not as self-regarding—but as a direct violation of liberty, chaining women by abolishing reciprocal obligation.
