- Modern conformity creates a “hostile censorship” where people suppress authentic preferences even in self-regarding matters, choosing by status-based custom until their capacities atrophy and they lack native tastes or opinions.
- This aligns with a Calvinistic ethos that treats self-will as sin and elevates obedience and self-abnegation; Mill rejects this, favoring a blended ideal: Greek “self-assertion” plus Christian/Platonic self-government. Better to cultivate rich, individualized excellence (e.g., Pericles) than uniform asceticism or ungoverned impulse.
- Liberty’s limit: necessary compression to prevent harm develops the social part of character; but restraint based only on others’ displeasure blunts and dulls nature, yielding no valuable growth except in resistance.
- Allowing diverse “lives” is essential; any force that crushes individuality is despotism, whatever its authority. Individuality is development; its cultivation makes people more valuable to themselves and to others and enriches collective life.
- Social utility: original individuals and “genius” are the “salt of the earth,” introducing new truths and reviving practices before they become mechanical. Genius needs an atmosphere of freedom; conformity either stifles it or stigmatizes it as “wild.”
- Mediocrity now rules via mass public opinion (channeled through newspapers). Democracies and large aristocracies tend toward mediocrity unless the many freely follow guidance from a more gifted one or few—without endorsing coercive hero-worship.
