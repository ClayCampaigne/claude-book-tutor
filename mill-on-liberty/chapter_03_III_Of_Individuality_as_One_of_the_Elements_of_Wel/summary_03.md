- Mass rule yields mediocrity unless the many freely follow guidance from a gifted one or few; but no coercive “hero-worship”: exceptional individuals should have freedom to point out the way, not to compel.
- In an age dominated by average opinion, pronounced individuality and even eccentricity are socially valuable: mere nonconformity helps break the tyranny of custom. The scarcity of eccentricity signals a grave danger.
- Self-chosen lives are not only for the highly gifted: people differ deeply in tastes, sources of pleasure and pain, and conditions needed for moral, mental, and aesthetic growth. A single model of life cannot fit all; diversity in modes of living is required for happiness and development.
- Public sentiment tolerates only widely shared tastes; those who do “what nobody does,” especially women, face stigma, status penalties, and even legal/institutional sanctions (e.g., being declared insane).
- Average people’s moderate inclinations plus a reformist, philanthropic drive produce prescriptive norms whose ideal is to desire nothing strongly, compressing distinctive character. Result: weak feelings and energies, with vigor confined to business or narrow hobbies.
- Custom is the standing hindrance to advancement; the only unfailing, permanent source of improvement is liberty, which creates many independent centers of progress. History is a struggle between Custom and the progressive principle.
- The East, especially China, shows how perfected custom and uniform education produce stagnation. Modern European public opinion risks an unorganized version of this. Europe’s past progress stemmed from diversity of characters, classes, and nations pursuing varied paths, each ultimately benefiting from others.
