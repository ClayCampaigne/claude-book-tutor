# AI Book Discussion Guide

## Welcome to Interactive Literary Exploration

This repository contains processed texts of public domain works, prepared for discussion with Claude using Claude Code. These materials enable deep, contextual conversations about classic philosophical and political texts.

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

1. **Install Claude Code** from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. **Clone this repository** to your local machine
3. **Open Claude Code** in the repository directory
4. **Start discussing** any of the included books

## 🎮 Taking Control of Your Discussion

**Hit ESC anytime** to interrupt Claude and redirect. You know what depth you need - deep textual analysis or quick overview - but Claude can't read your mind and will follow patterns unless directed otherwise.

Examples of active direction:
- `"Read the full text of chapter 3, not the summary"`
- `"Just give me the high-level overview"`  
- `"Find that quote in the original text"`
- `"Skip to chunk 4"`

Don't hesitate to course-correct mid-response. Your active guidance leads to much better results.

## 🤔 Understanding AI Book Discussions

### What You're Actually Reading

When you discuss these books with Claude, pay attention to **what Claude is actually reading**:

- **🔍 Watch the tool calls**: Claude will show when it's reading either:
  - `book_master_summary.md` - Ultra-condensed book overview created by GPT-5
  - `chapter_master_summary.md` - Two-part file: condensed chapter summary (top) + all chunk summaries (below)
  - `chunk_*.md` - Full original text divided into ~2500 word sections
  - `summary_*.md` - 150-word summaries of each chunk
  - `chapter_text.md` - Complete chapter text in one file

Understanding what Claude is accessing helps you gauge the depth and accuracy of the discussion.

### Critical Engagement Guidelines

**AI assistants like Claude are designed to be helpful and agreeable**, which means:

- ✅ **They excel at**: Stimulating ideas, finding connections, explaining complex concepts
- ⚠️ **They may**: Implicitly support your interpretations even when the text is ambiguous
- ❌ **They shouldn't**: Replace your own critical thinking or close reading

### Best Practices for Discussion

1. **Request textual evidence**: Ask Claude to quote or reference specific passages
2. **Challenge interpretations**: Don't accept claims without verification
3. **Cross-reference**: When Claude cites "general knowledge," ask for verification from the actual text
4. **Be specific**: Request that Claude read particular chapters or sections when discussing specific topics
5. **Think independently**: Use AI responses as starting points for your own analysis

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-reliance on AI memory**: Claude may blend general knowledge about these classic texts with the specific edition's content
- **Assumed agreement**: If you suggest an interpretation, Claude may support it even if the text is ambiguous
- **Surface-level reading**: Without prompting, Claude might work from summaries rather than full text
