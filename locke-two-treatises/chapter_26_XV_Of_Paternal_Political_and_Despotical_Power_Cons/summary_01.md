- Locke integrates prior distinctions by contrasting three powers—parental, political, and despotical—by their origins, ends, scope, and relation to property.
- Parental (paternal) power: a natural, fiduciary authority for the child’s good during minority, ending at the use of reason. It is non-arbitrary, excludes life-and-death power, does not reach an adult child’s property, and leaves only lifelong duties of honor, respect, and support.
- Political power: arises solely by compact—each person cedes the natural executive power (to preserve and punish under the law of nature) to society and its governors in trust. Its end and measure are the preservation of members’ lives, liberties, and possessions (property). It is not absolute: it legislates general laws and annexes penalties only as needed to preserve the whole (severing only truly corrupt parts). Its origin is mutual consent.
- Despotical power: an absolute, arbitrary dominion to take life at will; it comes neither from nature nor compact (no one can grant what he lacks over his own life). It arises only by forfeiture when an aggressor enters a state of war, making him liable to destruction; captives in a just war are thus subject. The moment conditions/compact enter, absolute slavery ceases and the state of war ends.
- Mapping by property: parental applies where minority disables managing property; political where persons have property at their own disposal; despotical over those stripped of all property. Absolute dominion is incompatible with civil society, as slavery is with property.
