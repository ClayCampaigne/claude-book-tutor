- Preservation priority: If a just conqueror’s war-damages and the vanquished family’s subsistence cannot both be fully met, the law of nature (preserve all as much as possible) requires the conqueror to remit part of his satisfaction to save dependents; a husband cannot forfeit his wife’s or children’s rights.

- War-damages ≠ title to land: The typical spoil (a few years’ product; money’s value is merely conventional) is far less than the perpetual inheritance of fully occupied land. Thus conquest cannot justify dispossessing the posterity of the vanquished of their estates.

- No dominion by conquest: Even in a just war, the conqueror gains no right over allies, neutrals, or the posterity of opponents. If the former regime is dissolved, they may freely found a new government.

- Coerced “consent” is null: Promises made under duress do not bind; force cannot create political obligation.

- Children remain free: Any absolute power acquired over unjust aggressors dies with them; their children owe no subjection absent their own consent.

- Two birthrights: (1) personal freedom; (2) a prior claim to inherit a father’s goods. Hence:
  - Birth under a government leaves one naturally free; disclaiming a lawful, consent-based government forfeits claims under its laws (e.g., inherited estates).
  - Descendants of peoples forced under conquest retain claims to their ancestors’ estates and a standing right to throw off usurping rule until a government exists by their free consent (e.g., Greek Christians vs. Ottoman rule).

- Grants create real property: Even if (contrary to Locke) a conqueror had right to persons and estates, once he grants land or leases, those holdings are true property that cannot be arbitrarily seized without voiding all contracts; princes are bound by God’s and nature’s law to keep promises.

- Conclusion: A just conqueror’s right extends only to aggressors’ lives and to compensation from their labor/estates without injuring others. Any attempt to rule beyond that puts him in a state of war with the people; such power is mere force, revocable when people can resist. Scripture (Hezekiah’s rebellion against Assyria) affirms casting off force-based domination.
