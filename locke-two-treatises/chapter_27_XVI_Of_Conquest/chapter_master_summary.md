<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter argues that conquest cannot found legitimate government. Force destroys regimes but cannot create rightful authority, because political obligation arises only from the people’s free consent. Promises extorted under duress do not bind; unjust conquest therefore confers no right to obedience. The conquered and their heirs retain a perpetual “appeal to heaven” to recover their native right to a legislature approved by the majority.

Even in a just war, the conqueror’s rights are narrowly limited. He gains no authority over those who fought with him; victors remain free sharers, not subjects by the sword. Against the vanquished, he acquires only a despotical power over the lives of those who actually assisted the unjust aggression. Innocents—subjects who neither authorized nor concurred in the wrong—forfeit nothing. Nor does victory grant title to the enemy’s lands or country: life may be forfeit for unjust force, but property is liable only so far as needed to repair damages and pay the war’s costs. The law of nature prioritizes preservation; wives and children retain their subsistence rights in the estate, which the conqueror must respect, remitting part of his satisfaction if resources are scarce. Because war-damages are typically limited to a few years’ products, they cannot justify dispossessing posterity of a perpetual inheritance in fully occupied land. Any absolute power over aggressors dies with them; their children are born free.

Politically, there is no dominion by conquest over allies, neutrals, or the posterity of opponents. If the former regime is dissolved, the people may institute a new government by consent. Two birthrights remain: personal freedom and a prior claim to inherit a father’s goods. Descendants of peoples forced under conquest retain claims to their ancestors’ estates and a standing right to cast off usurping rule until a government exists by their free consent. Moreover, once a conqueror grants land or leases, those holdings become true property; princes are bound to keep such promises.

The just conqueror’s right thus extends only to aggressors’ lives and proportionate compensation. Any attempt to rule beyond that is mere force, placing him in a state of war with the people and revocable whenever they can resist—a judgment Scripture itself approves in examples like Hezekiah’s defiance of Assyria.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Conquest does not found government. It destroys existing regimes but cannot erect a new legitimate one without the people’s consent; force is not consent. Promises extracted under duress do not bind.
- Unjust conquest yields no right to obedience. The conquered (or their heirs) retain a perpetual “appeal to heaven” to recover their native right to a legislature approved by the majority.
- Even in a just war, the conqueror gains:
  - No power over those who fought with him; they remain free and often share the spoils. Hence “title by the sword” cannot enslave the conquering people (e.g., Norman conquest cannot make Normans or their descendants subjects by conquest).
  - Only despotical power over the lives of those who actually assisted the unjust aggression. Subjects never authorized their rulers to make unjust war; innocents who did not concur in it forfeit nothing.
  - No automatic title to the conquered’s estates or country. Life may be forfeit for unjust force, but property is forfeit only to the extent needed to repair damages and costs of the war.
- Wives and children of aggressors retain rights in the estate; their subsistence has priority by the law of nature. If resources are scarce, the victor must remit part of satisfaction to preserve them.
- War damages seldom equal the value of large territories; thus conquest cannot justify proprietorship of a country, much less absolute dominion.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Preservation priority: If a just conqueror’s war-damages and the vanquished family’s subsistence cannot both be fully met, the law of nature (preserve all as much as possible) requires the conqueror to remit part of his satisfaction to save dependents; a husband cannot forfeit his wife’s or children’s rights.

- War-damages ≠ title to land: The typical spoil (a few years’ product; money’s value is merely conventional) is far less than the perpetual inheritance of fully occupied land. Thus conquest cannot justify dispossessing the posterity of the vanquished of their estates.

- No dominion by conquest: Even in a just war, the conqueror gains no right over allies, neutrals, or the posterity of opponents. If the former regime is dissolved, they may freely found a new government.

- Coerced “consent” is null: Promises made under duress do not bind; force cannot create political obligation.

- Children remain free: Any absolute power acquired over unjust aggressors dies with them; their children owe no subjection absent their own consent.

- Two birthrights: (1) personal freedom; (2) a prior claim to inherit a father’s goods. Hence:
  - Birth under a government leaves one naturally free; disclaiming a lawful, consent-based government forfeits claims under its laws (e.g., inherited estates).
  - Descendants of peoples forced under conquest retain claims to their ancestors’ estates and a standing right to throw off usurping rule until a government exists by their free consent (e.g., Greek Christians vs. Ottoman rule).

- Grants create real property: Even if (contrary to Locke) a conqueror had right to persons and estates, once he grants land or leases, those holdings are true property that cannot be arbitrarily seized without voiding all contracts; princes are bound by God’s and nature’s law to keep promises.

- Conclusion: A just conqueror’s right extends only to aggressors’ lives and to compensation from their labor/estates without injuring others. Any attempt to rule beyond that puts him in a state of war with the people; such power is mere force, revocable when people can resist. Scripture (Hezekiah’s rebellion against Assyria) affirms casting off force-based domination.
