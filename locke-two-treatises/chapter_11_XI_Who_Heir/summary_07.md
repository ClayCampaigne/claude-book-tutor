- Filmer claims God, “out of special care,” set Moses and Joshua “in the stead of supreme fathers,” and later “reestablished” lineal, paternal succession by giving Israel kings. Locke counters:
  - “Return out of bondage” implies return to freedom, distinguishing sons, subjects, and slaves; patriarchs did not own their children as chattel (shown by Reuben/Judah offering themselves as sureties to Jacob).
  - God’s choosing Moses (Levi) and Joshua (Ephraim) proves no fatherly title; neither had paternal claim. Divine choice of rulers no more validates fatherhood than God’s choice of Aaron proves priesthood belonged to Adam’s heir.
  - Judges were raised as capable leaders in peril, not as paternal heirs; God can raise generals without invoking fatherhood.

- “Reestablishing” lineal paternal right would mean restoring the same ancestral power to the true next heir. But:
  - Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) had no regal power.
  - Israelite succession contradicts primogeniture/lineal right: Saul (Benjamin), David (Judah, youngest), Solomon (younger son), Jeroboam (non-Davidic), Athaliah (non-royal woman).

- Filmer’s “issue also shall have benefit” claim fails: a grant to “issue” leaves succession indeterminate unless God specifies which heir. By that logic all issue have equal claims, like Abraham’s seed to Canaan.

- From Moses to David (~400 years), authority did not descend to rulers’ sons (e.g., Jephthah chosen by compact). Israel functioned through assemblies (Judges 19–21), evidencing non-monarchical governance.

- Thus either fatherly authority doesn’t imply monarchy or God didn’t preserve it—both ruin Filmer. He lacks any revealed rule that God intends chosen kings’ issue (and which issue) to inherit.
