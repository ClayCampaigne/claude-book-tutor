- If Noah divided the world among his sons, Adamic heirship and “natural” monarchy collapse. A true divine, hereditary right cannot be altered by any man; if it can be altered, it is merely human institution, so people may frame government and succession as they please, and primogeniture has no natural claim over siblings.

- Filmer’s appeal to nations tracing origins to Noah’s sons/nephews is irrelevant: genealogical pride or mythic ancestries (e.g., Hercules, Brama, Jupiter) do not prove a right to Adam’s lordship.

- Likewise, tales of Noah’s dividing Asia/Africa/Europe are speculative and, if granted, still destroy the single-heir principle. Filmer’s concession that “parents were heads and princes” over families implies either:
  - one universal monarch (eldest only), or
  - many independent family-principalities (all fathers equally).
  Either outcome contradicts existing kingdoms and Filmer’s model.

- At Babel, Genesis names families, tongues, lands, nations—not rulers. Grouping by language proves no paternal sovereignty. Scripturally, the Shinar episode reads as common deliberation (“they said… let us build us a city”) of free people, not command by an absolute heir (Shem was alive if such a title mattered).

- Claiming God “preserved fatherly authority” by instantly multiplying 72 distinct rulers is self-contradictory; it would be like “preserving monarchy” by shattering one empire into many states. The notion that 72 fathers suddenly discovered unknown paternal sovereignty is absurd.

- Net: Scripture does not establish regal power by Adamic descent at Babel; Filmer’s assertions rest on conjecture and yield contradictions that either implode universal heirship or fragment authority into mere family rule.
