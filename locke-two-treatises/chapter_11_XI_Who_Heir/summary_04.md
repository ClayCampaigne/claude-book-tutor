- Household power and war-making don’t prove Adamic inheritance. Abraham’s authority over “menservants and maidservants” arose from purchase and household increase, not descent; that’s no more proof of universal lordship than owning a warhorse proves inherited sovereignty.

- “Making war and peace” marks sovereignty only within a political society’s supreme power. Individuals, ships’ captains, or ad hoc bands can wage or end hostilities by consent without being sovereigns. Otherwise commonwealths—who also make war and peace—would be Adam’s heirs, collapsing Filmer’s monarchy. Filmer in fact claims all governing authority (even in commonwealths) is “regal,” which absurdly turns every regime into a monarchy.

- Scriptural practice contradicts Abrahamic kingship by descent: Abraham and Lot relate and separate as equals by consent; Abraham’s servant touts wealth, not a crown; Abraham owned no land until he bought a burial plot.

- Esau’s 400 men cannot prove kingship; Filmer’s method yields the absurdity of both Esau (by force) and Jacob (by birthright) being simultaneous absolute heirs.

- “Patriarchal” is a name, not evidence of universal monarchy before the Flood; Scripture records none.

- On Noah’s sons: if only the eldest inherits, the others are slaves; if all inherit, parity makes all mankind equal and independent, refuting “heirs are lords of brethren.” Filmer also contradicts himself on birthright (denying God’s “disinheritance” of Noah yet allowing Noah to divide the world). If Noah’s division stands, heir-right is human, not divine; governments then rest on human institution and consent. Claims that “most civilized nations” trace to Noah’s line are dubious.
