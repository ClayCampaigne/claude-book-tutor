- Locke frames the decisive political question as “who should have power?” If this is unclear, doctrines of absolute power only inflame ambition and disorder. Filmer, claiming civil power is divinely assigned to Adam’s heir (like the Aaronic priesthood), is therefore obligated to specify the rightful person with clarity.

- Filmer fails to do so. His phrase “eldest parents” is unintelligible for identifying a determinate heir; “parents” cannot mean “heirs male,” nor can “eldest parents” be an infant heir. Such vagueness leaves subjects no way to know whom to obey.

- Filmer’s “limitation” of Adam’s power to his “line and posterity” is useless: it includes all humans and so identifies no single heir. Locke suggests Filmer avoids clear descent rules because they would be impracticable and politically unhelpful.

- Filmer seems to hint at primogeniture via Cain and Jacob, but Locke denies any natural dominion of an elder brother over siblings. Mosaic law grants the firstborn a double portion of goods, not political superiority.

- Cain/Abel (Gen. 4): God’s words to Cain are conditional (“if thou doest well”) and personal, not a charter of birthright dominion; moreover, by Filmer’s own admission Abel already had private property, contradicting an heir’s universal title.

- Jacob/Esau (Gen. 27): Isaac’s blessing (“be lord over thy brethren”) was given under the mistake that Jacob was Esau, and Esau treats birthright and blessing as distinct; thus dominion does not follow birthright. Gen. 21:10 (“shall not be heir”) concerns estate shares, not sovereignty.
