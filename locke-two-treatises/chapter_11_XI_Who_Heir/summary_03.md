- Locke insists the key question is “who has the right to be obeyed?” Labels (paternal/regal) are irrelevant without a determinate person. He then floods Filmer’s heir-theory with concrete succession dilemmas that nature/Scripture do not resolve: grandson via daughter vs nephew via brother; infant grandson of eldest son vs adult younger son; daughter vs uncle; younger daughter’s son vs elder daughter’s daughter; elder son by concubine vs younger by wife; legitimacy disputes; folly disqualifications and who judges; claims through an excluded fool vs a reigning wise brother; pregnancy interregna; precedence among twins; half-blood sister vs whole-blood brother’s daughter. History shows such cases have actually troubled crowns (e.g., in the other kingdom of the island).

- Until Filmer supplies clear natural or divine rules to resolve these, his Adamic, hereditary monarchy cannot ground obligation; an unknown heir yields no duty of obedience. Analogies: asserting divinely-inherited powers to absolve sins or cure diseases is useless if the heir is unknowable. Civil (human) laws cannot decide a right that is, by claim, antecedent to all law.

- Divine institutions are never given without identifying criteria; Scripture nowhere ordains “the next heir” to inherit all dominion. “Heir” in Scripture denotes estate-sharing, not exclusive sovereignty (e.g., Sarah’s fear Ishmael might be “heir with Isaac”).

- Filmer’s historical “proofs” fail: Judah’s sentencing Tamar shows, at most, an act, not a right (by that logic Absalom was sovereign). Abraham’s 318 retainers, Esau’s 400, and treaties reflect household wealth or purchase-based authority, not inheritance of Adam’s universal lordship.
