<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke makes the decisive political question “who has the right to be obeyed?” and argues that Filmer’s patriarchal absolutism never answers it. Filmer says Adam’s authority descends to “the heir,” yet he cannot identify that person. His phrases (“eldest parents,” Adam’s “line and posterity”) are either unintelligible or so capacious they include everyone. Because neither nature nor Scripture supplies workable rules of descent, subjects cannot know whom to obey; pressed with real succession dilemmas (claims through daughters, brothers, infants, concubines vs wives, legitimacy, twins, interregna), Filmer must collapse into “present possession,” which makes obedience equally due to usurpers.

Scripture does not rescue him. The Cain and Jacob narratives do not confer birthright dominion: God’s words to Cain are conditional and personal; Isaac’s blessing was given in error; Esau distinguishes “birthright” from “blessing.” Throughout, “heir” means a larger share of goods, not sovereignty: Sarah’s “shall not be heir,” Abraham giving Isaac “all,” Chronicles’ division—Joseph holds the birthright (double portion) while Judah holds dominion—show lordship is no part of primogeniture. Nor do patriarchal episodes prove Adamic kingship: Abraham’s power is household authority by purchase and consent; war-making and treaties do not imply universal sovereignty; Abraham and Lot part as equals; Esau’s retinue cannot establish kingship. Filmer’s method even makes every commonwealth “regal,” erasing the difference between monarchy and other regimes.

Appeals to Noah and Babel are self-defeating. If only the eldest inherits, all others are slaves; if all sons inherit, parity destroys fraternal lordship. The Babel story records families, tongues, and collective deliberation, not a single heir’s rule (Shem was still alive). Multiplying 72 “fathers” would annihilate any one Adamic title; monarchy beyond the family then rests on consent, not paternal right.

Israel’s polity likewise contradicts Filmer. God’s choosing Moses, Joshua, and judges confers no fatherly title; succession is neither lineal nor primogenitary; when hereditary right is intended, God specifies the line—otherwise not (as with Saul). Across centuries, paternal monarchy is absent or intermittent. Locke’s net: without a determinate heir or revealed rules, Adamic, hereditary monarchy cannot ground obligation; political authority rests on human institution and consent.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke frames the decisive political question as “who should have power?” If this is unclear, doctrines of absolute power only inflame ambition and disorder. Filmer, claiming civil power is divinely assigned to Adam’s heir (like the Aaronic priesthood), is therefore obligated to specify the rightful person with clarity.

- Filmer fails to do so. His phrase “eldest parents” is unintelligible for identifying a determinate heir; “parents” cannot mean “heirs male,” nor can “eldest parents” be an infant heir. Such vagueness leaves subjects no way to know whom to obey.

- Filmer’s “limitation” of Adam’s power to his “line and posterity” is useless: it includes all humans and so identifies no single heir. Locke suggests Filmer avoids clear descent rules because they would be impracticable and politically unhelpful.

- Filmer seems to hint at primogeniture via Cain and Jacob, but Locke denies any natural dominion of an elder brother over siblings. Mosaic law grants the firstborn a double portion of goods, not political superiority.

- Cain/Abel (Gen. 4): God’s words to Cain are conditional (“if thou doest well”) and personal, not a charter of birthright dominion; moreover, by Filmer’s own admission Abel already had private property, contradicting an heir’s universal title.

- Jacob/Esau (Gen. 27): Isaac’s blessing (“be lord over thy brethren”) was given under the mistake that Jacob was Esau, and Esau treats birthright and blessing as distinct; thus dominion does not follow birthright. Gen. 21:10 (“shall not be heir”) concerns estate shares, not sovereignty.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Locke shows birthright did not entail dominion. In the Jacob–Esau story, Isaac blessed Jacob believing him to be Esau; Esau himself distinguishes “birthright” from “blessing,” so lordship cannot be the birthright’s content. Patriarchal practice confirms this: Sarah’s “shall not be heir” (Gen 21:10) concerns estate shares, not rule; Abraham gave Isaac “all,” but only gifts to sons of concubines and sent them away—heirship = larger portion, not sovereignty. Chronicles 5:1 and Gen 48:22 make it explicit: Joseph held the birthright (double portion), while Judah held dominion; therefore dominion is no part of the birthright.

- Gen 27:29 is a prophecy about posterities (Israel over Edom), not Jacob’s personal rule over Esau; historically Esau was never subject to Jacob—indeed Jacob bows to him—so it cannot prove fraternal subjection. Likewise Gen 4 concerns sin, not Abel; it yields no rule-of-heir.

- Filmer claims Adam’s power descends to “the heir” as lord over all brethren, but never identifies who the heir is. Without a determinate person, “paternal power” cannot ground obligation, forcing Filmer to default to present possession—making obedience equally due to usurpers.

- Locke presses unresolved succession cases (no son; claims through daughters, brothers, infants, concubines vs wives, legitimacy), noting that neither nature nor Scripture supplies determinate rules; municipal laws are irrelevant to a supposed divine/natural title.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Locke insists the key question is “who has the right to be obeyed?” Labels (paternal/regal) are irrelevant without a determinate person. He then floods Filmer’s heir-theory with concrete succession dilemmas that nature/Scripture do not resolve: grandson via daughter vs nephew via brother; infant grandson of eldest son vs adult younger son; daughter vs uncle; younger daughter’s son vs elder daughter’s daughter; elder son by concubine vs younger by wife; legitimacy disputes; folly disqualifications and who judges; claims through an excluded fool vs a reigning wise brother; pregnancy interregna; precedence among twins; half-blood sister vs whole-blood brother’s daughter. History shows such cases have actually troubled crowns (e.g., in the other kingdom of the island).

- Until Filmer supplies clear natural or divine rules to resolve these, his Adamic, hereditary monarchy cannot ground obligation; an unknown heir yields no duty of obedience. Analogies: asserting divinely-inherited powers to absolve sins or cure diseases is useless if the heir is unknowable. Civil (human) laws cannot decide a right that is, by claim, antecedent to all law.

- Divine institutions are never given without identifying criteria; Scripture nowhere ordains “the next heir” to inherit all dominion. “Heir” in Scripture denotes estate-sharing, not exclusive sovereignty (e.g., Sarah’s fear Ishmael might be “heir with Isaac”).

- Filmer’s historical “proofs” fail: Judah’s sentencing Tamar shows, at most, an act, not a right (by that logic Absalom was sovereign). Abraham’s 318 retainers, Esau’s 400, and treaties reflect household wealth or purchase-based authority, not inheritance of Adam’s universal lordship.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Household power and war-making don’t prove Adamic inheritance. Abraham’s authority over “menservants and maidservants” arose from purchase and household increase, not descent; that’s no more proof of universal lordship than owning a warhorse proves inherited sovereignty.

- “Making war and peace” marks sovereignty only within a political society’s supreme power. Individuals, ships’ captains, or ad hoc bands can wage or end hostilities by consent without being sovereigns. Otherwise commonwealths—who also make war and peace—would be Adam’s heirs, collapsing Filmer’s monarchy. Filmer in fact claims all governing authority (even in commonwealths) is “regal,” which absurdly turns every regime into a monarchy.

- Scriptural practice contradicts Abrahamic kingship by descent: Abraham and Lot relate and separate as equals by consent; Abraham’s servant touts wealth, not a crown; Abraham owned no land until he bought a burial plot.

- Esau’s 400 men cannot prove kingship; Filmer’s method yields the absurdity of both Esau (by force) and Jacob (by birthright) being simultaneous absolute heirs.

- “Patriarchal” is a name, not evidence of universal monarchy before the Flood; Scripture records none.

- On Noah’s sons: if only the eldest inherits, the others are slaves; if all inherit, parity makes all mankind equal and independent, refuting “heirs are lords of brethren.” Filmer also contradicts himself on birthright (denying God’s “disinheritance” of Noah yet allowing Noah to divide the world). If Noah’s division stands, heir-right is human, not divine; governments then rest on human institution and consent. Claims that “most civilized nations” trace to Noah’s line are dubious.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- If Noah divided the world among his sons, Adamic heirship and “natural” monarchy collapse. A true divine, hereditary right cannot be altered by any man; if it can be altered, it is merely human institution, so people may frame government and succession as they please, and primogeniture has no natural claim over siblings.

- Filmer’s appeal to nations tracing origins to Noah’s sons/nephews is irrelevant: genealogical pride or mythic ancestries (e.g., Hercules, Brama, Jupiter) do not prove a right to Adam’s lordship.

- Likewise, tales of Noah’s dividing Asia/Africa/Europe are speculative and, if granted, still destroy the single-heir principle. Filmer’s concession that “parents were heads and princes” over families implies either:
  - one universal monarch (eldest only), or
  - many independent family-principalities (all fathers equally).
  Either outcome contradicts existing kingdoms and Filmer’s model.

- At Babel, Genesis names families, tongues, lands, nations—not rulers. Grouping by language proves no paternal sovereignty. Scripturally, the Shinar episode reads as common deliberation (“they said… let us build us a city”) of free people, not command by an absolute heir (Shem was alive if such a title mattered).

- Claiming God “preserved fatherly authority” by instantly multiplying 72 distinct rulers is self-contradictory; it would be like “preserving monarchy” by shattering one empire into many states. The notion that 72 fathers suddenly discovered unknown paternal sovereignty is absurd.

- Net: Scripture does not establish regal power by Adamic descent at Babel; Filmer’s assertions rest on conjecture and yield contradictions that either implode universal heirship or fragment authority into mere family rule.
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Locke attacks Filmer’s Babel thesis: with Shem still alive, it is impossible that 72 new “fathers” suddenly acquired sovereign fatherly authority over the same people. Either (a) they were already separate rulers (so not “one people”), or (b) the people had been a commonwealth (no monarchy), or (c) these fathers had authority but unknowingly—an absurdity made worse by supposing the confusion of tongues instantly revealed precise jurisdictions. If God “preserved fatherly authority” in 72 nations, He simultaneously nullified any claim of Adam’s single heir, since at least 71 rulers could not be that heir.

- On Nimrod: if “lords of families” means natural fathers, then seizing their rights makes monarchy beyond the family either usurpation/tyranny or else rests on the consent of fathers—functionally, consent of the people—undercutting Filmer’s patriarchal absolutism.

- Filmer’s catalog of many petty kings (Edom, Canaan, etc.) refutes descent from Adam: fatherhood could yield at most authority over one’s own issue, and Adam’s universal fatherhood could descend to only one at a time. These kings therefore derive power from another source.

- “Patriarchal jurisdiction” is equivocal. If it means absolute monarchy, it wasn’t “intermitted” in Egypt (there was a king). If it means something else, it’s irrelevant to Adamic right. Scripture shows no line of rulers claiming Adamic heirship.

- Filmer’s claim that God set Moses and Joshua as princes “in the stead of supreme fathers” implies Israel returned from bondage to freedom, distinguishing sons, subjects, and slaves—contrary to Filmer’s notion of subjects as a patriarch’s property.
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Filmer claims God, “out of special care,” set Moses and Joshua “in the stead of supreme fathers,” and later “reestablished” lineal, paternal succession by giving Israel kings. Locke counters:
  - “Return out of bondage” implies return to freedom, distinguishing sons, subjects, and slaves; patriarchs did not own their children as chattel (shown by Reuben/Judah offering themselves as sureties to Jacob).
  - God’s choosing Moses (Levi) and Joshua (Ephraim) proves no fatherly title; neither had paternal claim. Divine choice of rulers no more validates fatherhood than God’s choice of Aaron proves priesthood belonged to Adam’s heir.
  - Judges were raised as capable leaders in peril, not as paternal heirs; God can raise generals without invoking fatherhood.

- “Reestablishing” lineal paternal right would mean restoring the same ancestral power to the true next heir. But:
  - Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) had no regal power.
  - Israelite succession contradicts primogeniture/lineal right: Saul (Benjamin), David (Judah, youngest), Solomon (younger son), Jeroboam (non-Davidic), Athaliah (non-royal woman).

- Filmer’s “issue also shall have benefit” claim fails: a grant to “issue” leaves succession indeterminate unless God specifies which heir. By that logic all issue have equal claims, like Abraham’s seed to Canaan.

- From Moses to David (~400 years), authority did not descend to rulers’ sons (e.g., Jephthah chosen by compact). Israel functioned through assemblies (Judges 19–21), evidencing non-monarchical governance.

- Thus either fatherly authority doesn’t imply monarchy or God didn’t preserve it—both ruin Filmer. He lacks any revealed rule that God intends chosen kings’ issue (and which issue) to inherit.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Locke argues it is incredible that if “fatherly authority” were a divinely ordained, foundational principle of all government, God would omit and conceal it among Israel for centuries while prescribing their polity. Judges shows collective deliberation, not monarchy; thus either God did not “preserve” fatherhood, or fatherhood does not entail monarchy.

- He challenges Filmer’s axiom that whenever God chooses a king He intends the king’s “issue” to inherit. Neither natural law nor revelation says this, and unless God also specifies which issue, succession devolves into division or scrambling—defeating the supposed benefit. Scripture’s pattern contradicts Filmer: when inheritance is intended, God names the “seed” (Abraham, Aaron, David), while Saul’s kingship, given without mention of his seed, did not pass to his issue.

- Parity objection: if God’s grant of “fatherly authority” to a king ipso facto entails hereditary descent, the same should hold for judges, since both offices are by God’s choice; Filmer offers no reason to differentiate.

- Surveying Israel’s history: from entry into Egypt to the Exodus (~200+ years), no paternal government; from Exodus to kings (~400 years), none; hereditary monarchy runs only from Saul/David to the captivity (~500 years), after which to Rome’s destruction (~650 years) hereditary, lineal “paternal” right is absent. Thus, across ~1,750 years, hereditary kingship appears less than a third, with no trace of Adamic/paternal succession even then.
