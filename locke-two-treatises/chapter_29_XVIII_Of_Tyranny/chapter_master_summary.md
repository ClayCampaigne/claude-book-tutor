<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
The chapter distinguishes tyranny from usurpation and grounds political authority in law. Usurpation is taking another’s place; tyranny is exercising power beyond right—substituting will for law and using public power for private ends such as ambition, revenge, or covetousness, rather than preserving the people’s lives, liberties, and estates. Tyranny can arise under any form of rule, whether by one or many, as shown by Athens’ Thirty and Rome’s decemvirs. Drawing on King James I, the chapter insists a rightful king is bound by fundamental laws—implicitly by the office and explicitly by coronation oath—and governs for the public good; when rulers depart from law, they degenerate into tyrants. Wealth and power worsen, not excuse, oppression.

“Where law ends, tyranny begins”: any official who exceeds legal authority and uses force against what the law permits ceases, in that act, to be a magistrate and may be resisted like a private assailant. Commissions cannot legalize what the law forbids; authority derives from law, not from the words of a warrant.

To avoid anarchy, resistance is strictly conditioned. In polities where the prince’s person is sacred, it remains inviolable; illegal force by subordinates may be opposed unless the prince himself makes war on the people. Subordinates wielding unjust force under color of royal command may be resisted, because the king cannot authorize illegality. Force is lawful only when legal recourse is blocked—when there is a state of war—and deadly defense is justified only against life‑threatening force, not remediable wrongs. Private, isolated injuries seldom unsettle government; but widespread or precedent‑setting illegalities that endanger laws, properties, liberties, lives, or religion will rouse collective defense.

Practical signs of tyrannical design include divergence between professions and actions; legal “arts” to evade law; prerogative bent from public good to harm; compliant magistrates promoted; recurring experiments in arbitrary power; covert favor to a religion apt to advance absolutism; and a sustained sequence of measures pointing one way. A long train of such actions makes the people’s inference—like judging a captain steering toward Algiers—rational. When rulers create this pattern, popular resistance to illegal force is predictable; the blame and peril lie with those who pervert law and prerogative, not with a people seeking self‑preservation.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Definition and scope: Tyranny differs from usurpation. Usurpation is exercising another’s right; tyranny is exercising power beyond right—using public power for private ends, substituting will for law, and aiming at ambition, revenge, or covetousness rather than preserving subjects’ properties. It can occur in any regime (one or many): Athens’ Thirty, Rome’s decemvirs.
- King James I as authority: A rightful king is bound by fundamental laws (tacitly by kingship, expressly by coronation oath) and governs for the public good; departing from rule by law degenerates a king into a tyrant. Good kings bound themselves within legal limits; counselors urging the contrary are pests.
- Where law ends, tyranny begins: Any official who exceeds legal power and uses force against what the law allows ceases, in that act, to be a magistrate and may be resisted like any private invader. Commissions cannot authorize what the law forbids; authority comes from law, not the warrant’s words.
- Wealth/power aggravate, not excuse, oppression.
- Resistance conditions (to avoid anarchy):
  1) In polities where the prince’s person is sacred, his person remains inviolable; illegal acts by subordinates may be opposed unless he himself makes war on the people.
  2) Subordinates using unjust force under color of royal commission may be resisted; the king cannot authorize illegality.
  3) Force is lawful only when appeal to law is blocked (state of war). Deadly defense is justified against life‑threatening force, not against remediable wrongs.
  4) Private, isolated wrongs rarely disturb government. But widespread or precedent‑setting illegalities that threaten laws, estates, liberties, lives, or religion will move people to resist—especially when a sustained pattern (abuse of prerogative, partisan ministers, experiments in arbitrary power, covertly favored religion) reveals designs toward arbitrary rule.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Good rulers can’t help but make their people “see and feel” their care; if they truly aim at preserving laws and people, this is evident. The perilous condition of being generally suspected is thus the governors’ own, avoidable doing.
- Signals of tyrannical design: 
  - Pretenses vs actions diverge; legal “arts” are used to evade law.
  - Prerogative—an discretionary power entrusted to do good—is bent against its end to harm the people.
  - Subordinate magistrates are selected, favored, or dismissed according to their willingness to advance arbitrary aims.
  - “Experiments” in arbitrary power recur.
  - A religion likeliest to introduce arbitrary rule is covertly encouraged and its agents supported or at least approved, despite public denunciations.
  - A sustained sequence of measures points in the same direction.
- Given such a long train of consistent actions, people cannot help but conclude which way things are going and seek self-preservation; this inference is as rational as judging a captain steering persistently toward Algiers despite temporary deviations.
- Therefore, when rulers generate this pattern, widespread resistance to illegal force becomes predictable; the fault and risk lie with those who pervert law and prerogative, not with the people who discern and react to the danger.
