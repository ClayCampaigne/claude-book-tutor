- Legislative supremacy and popular reserve power: In any constituted commonwealth the legislative is supreme over all other powers. Yet it is a fiduciary trust for the public end (preservation of liberty and property). If that end is manifestly neglected or opposed, the trust is forfeited and a supreme power reverts to the people to alter or remove the legislative. This popular power operates only when government is dissolved; while government subsists, the legislative remains supreme.

- Executive status and allegiance: Where a single executive also shares in legislation (e.g., has a necessary consent), he may be called “supreme” only as supreme executor, not as lawmaker. Oaths bind to him as the public executor of law. Acting by private will, he ceases to represent the commonwealth and has no right to obedience. An executive without a legislative share is subordinate and removable by the legislative. All subordinate offices hold only delegated, accountable authority.

- Convening power, obstruction, and state of war: The executive’s prerogative to convene/dismiss the legislature is a trust for public safety, given the variability of affairs; it confers no superiority. If he uses force to prevent necessary meetings, he initiates a state of war; the people may oppose force and reinstate the legislative.

- Continuity and recall: The executive must always be in being; the legislative need not. The legislature may resume delegated execution and punish maladministration. Representative bodies assemble per constitution or adjournment; if electors choose representatives for terms, elections occur at fixed times or when duly summoned (often by the executive, ministerially or as prudence requires).

- Prerogative and reforming representation: Over time, representation can become grossly disproportionate. Under the rule salus populi suprema lex, an executive entrusted with convoking may, by true reason rather than obsolete custom, rebalance representation to match each place’s real contribution, thereby restoring—not altering—the rightful legislative frame. Such manifestly public-good measures exemplify just prerogative.
