- Just prerogative to rebalance representation: An executive entrusted to convene the legislature may, guided by salus populi suprema lex, correct disproportions by fixing representation according to “true proportion,” i.e., each place’s contribution/assistance to the public, not obsolete custom.

- Restoration, not innovation: Such regulation does not create a new legislature but restores the original, rightful frame by rectifying time-born disorders. The people’s interest and intent are a fair and equal representative; whoever brings representation nearest to that aim strengthens, not alters, the government and will have public consent.

- Nature of prerogative: Prerogative is a discretionary power to provide for the public good in unforeseen cases where fixed laws cannot safely direct. Acts manifestly for the people’s good and that re-establish the government on its true foundations are “just prerogative.”

- Corporations and changing rights: The power to erect new corporations (with representatives) presupposes that representation must vary over time. Places newly significant may rightly gain seats; decayed or insignificant places may rightly lose them.

- Legitimacy test for change: Change per se is not an inroad; only changes tending to oppress or privilege a party over the rest are. Measures plainly advantageous on just and durable principles justify themselves. When representatives are chosen on undeniably equal measures suitable to the original frame, the act is the society’s will—whoever enabled it.
