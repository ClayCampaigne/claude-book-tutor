<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter argues that in any constituted commonwealth the legislative power is supreme, but only as a fiduciary trust aimed at preserving the people’s liberty and property. Should that end be manifestly neglected or opposed, the trust is forfeited and, upon a dissolution of government, supreme authority reverts to the people to alter or remove the legislative. While government subsists, however, the legislative remains the highest power.

The executive’s status derives from execution, not lawmaking. Even where a single executive has a necessary share in legislation, he is “supreme” only as the chief executor. Oaths bind subjects to him as the public minister of the laws; acting by private will, he ceases to represent the commonwealth and has no claim to obedience. An executive without a legislative share is strictly subordinate and removable by the legislative, and all subordinate offices hold delegated, accountable authority.

Because public affairs are variable, the executive is entrusted with prerogatives such as convening or dismissing the legislature; these are trusts for safety, not marks of superiority. If he uses force to prevent necessary meetings, he thereby makes war on the people, who may oppose force and restore the legislative. The executive must always be in being; the legislative need not. The legislature may resume delegated execution and punish maladministration. Representative bodies meet as the constitution or prior adjournments provide; elections occur at fixed times or upon due summons, often issued by the executive in a merely ministerial or prudential capacity.

Prerogative is a discretionary power to provide for the public good where fixed laws cannot foresee. Its just use is measured by salus populi suprema lex. Thus, when representation has grown grossly disproportionate, an executive entrusted to convoke may, by true reason rather than obsolete custom, rebalance seats to reflect each place’s genuine contribution—by erecting new corporations or reducing decayed ones. Such measures restore, rather than innovate upon, the rightful legislative frame. Change is illegitimate only when it oppresses or privileges a party; measures plainly advantageous on equal and durable principles both justify themselves and express the society’s will, whoever enabled them.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Legislative supremacy and popular reserve power: In any constituted commonwealth the legislative is supreme over all other powers. Yet it is a fiduciary trust for the public end (preservation of liberty and property). If that end is manifestly neglected or opposed, the trust is forfeited and a supreme power reverts to the people to alter or remove the legislative. This popular power operates only when government is dissolved; while government subsists, the legislative remains supreme.

- Executive status and allegiance: Where a single executive also shares in legislation (e.g., has a necessary consent), he may be called “supreme” only as supreme executor, not as lawmaker. Oaths bind to him as the public executor of law. Acting by private will, he ceases to represent the commonwealth and has no right to obedience. An executive without a legislative share is subordinate and removable by the legislative. All subordinate offices hold only delegated, accountable authority.

- Convening power, obstruction, and state of war: The executive’s prerogative to convene/dismiss the legislature is a trust for public safety, given the variability of affairs; it confers no superiority. If he uses force to prevent necessary meetings, he initiates a state of war; the people may oppose force and reinstate the legislative.

- Continuity and recall: The executive must always be in being; the legislative need not. The legislature may resume delegated execution and punish maladministration. Representative bodies assemble per constitution or adjournment; if electors choose representatives for terms, elections occur at fixed times or when duly summoned (often by the executive, ministerially or as prudence requires).

- Prerogative and reforming representation: Over time, representation can become grossly disproportionate. Under the rule salus populi suprema lex, an executive entrusted with convoking may, by true reason rather than obsolete custom, rebalance representation to match each place’s real contribution, thereby restoring—not altering—the rightful legislative frame. Such manifestly public-good measures exemplify just prerogative.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Just prerogative to rebalance representation: An executive entrusted to convene the legislature may, guided by salus populi suprema lex, correct disproportions by fixing representation according to “true proportion,” i.e., each place’s contribution/assistance to the public, not obsolete custom.

- Restoration, not innovation: Such regulation does not create a new legislature but restores the original, rightful frame by rectifying time-born disorders. The people’s interest and intent are a fair and equal representative; whoever brings representation nearest to that aim strengthens, not alters, the government and will have public consent.

- Nature of prerogative: Prerogative is a discretionary power to provide for the public good in unforeseen cases where fixed laws cannot safely direct. Acts manifestly for the people’s good and that re-establish the government on its true foundations are “just prerogative.”

- Corporations and changing rights: The power to erect new corporations (with representatives) presupposes that representation must vary over time. Places newly significant may rightly gain seats; decayed or insignificant places may rightly lose them.

- Legitimacy test for change: Change per se is not an inroad; only changes tending to oppress or privilege a party over the rest are. Measures plainly advantageous on just and durable principles justify themselves. When representatives are chosen on undeniably equal measures suitable to the original frame, the act is the society’s will—whoever enabled it.
