- Target text: Genesis 3:16 (“thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee”). Filmer calls this “the original grant of government,” fixing supreme power in fatherhood and in monarchy.

- Locke’s context argument: The verse occurs in God’s judgment/curse after the Fall, not in a moment of conferring privileges. It is incoherent that God would at once elevate Adam to universal monarchy and condemn him to lifelong toilsome labor (“in the sweat of thy face…”). Even with many descendants, the sentence binds Adam personally to labor, not to princely ease.

- Addressed to Eve, not Adam; it contains no grant to Adam. If taken representatively, it concerns women’s ordinary subjection to husbands, akin to childbirth pains—foretold conditions, not moral duties that cannot be mitigated.

- Hermeneutic consistency: Filmer’s readings violate ordinary language. He treats singular statements to Adam as to all mankind, plural grants in Genesis 1 as to Adam alone, and joint words to Noah and his sons as to Noah alone.

- Scope: At most the verse grounds conjugal, not political, authority; otherwise every husband would be a monarch. The phrase “thy desire shall be to thy husband” is too ambiguous to bear Filmer’s claim.

- Conclusion: The two texts Filmer cites (Gen 1:28; Gen 3:16) establish dominion over animals and wives’ subordination, not absolute political sovereignty “as large as all the acts” of Adam’s will. Assertions without proof can be denied.
