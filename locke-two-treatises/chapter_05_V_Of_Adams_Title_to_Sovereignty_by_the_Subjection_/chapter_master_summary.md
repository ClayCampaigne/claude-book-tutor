<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke targets Filmer’s claim that Genesis 3:16—“thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee”—is the “original grant of government” that fixes supreme power in fatherhood and thereby in monarchy. Locke first situates the verse: it appears in the pronouncement of judgment after the Fall, not in any scene of conferring privilege or political office. It is incoherent, he argues, to suppose that God, in the same breath that condemns Adam to lifelong, toilsome labor—“in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread”—also elevates him to universal kingship. Even if Adam were soon surrounded by descendants, the sentence binds him personally to labor; it does not inaugurate princely ease or political dominion.

Locke further notes the verse is addressed to Eve, not to Adam, and therefore contains no grant to Adam at all. If taken representatively, it speaks to the ordinary subjection of wives to husbands, paired with the pain of childbirth—conditions foretold as consequences, not moral duties beyond mitigation by prudence or charity. Filmer’s method compounds the error: he inconsistently treats singular statements to Adam as if spoken to all mankind, while reading the plural grants of Genesis 1 as if given to Adam alone, and terms addressed jointly to Noah and his sons as if to Noah alone. Such hermeneutics violate ordinary language.

At most, Genesis 3:16 could underwrite conjugal authority, not political sovereignty; to read it politically would make every husband a monarch. Nor can the ambiguous clause “thy desire shall be to thy husband” bear the weight Filmer places on it. In sum, the two texts he cites—Genesis 1:28 and 3:16—establish human dominion over animals and the subordination of wives within marriage, not an absolute civil sovereignty “as large as all the acts” of Adam’s will. Assertions made without proof, Locke concludes, may be denied without ceremony.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Target text: Genesis 3:16 (“thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee”). Filmer calls this “the original grant of government,” fixing supreme power in fatherhood and in monarchy.

- Locke’s context argument: The verse occurs in God’s judgment/curse after the Fall, not in a moment of conferring privileges. It is incoherent that God would at once elevate Adam to universal monarchy and condemn him to lifelong toilsome labor (“in the sweat of thy face…”). Even with many descendants, the sentence binds Adam personally to labor, not to princely ease.

- Addressed to Eve, not Adam; it contains no grant to Adam. If taken representatively, it concerns women’s ordinary subjection to husbands, akin to childbirth pains—foretold conditions, not moral duties that cannot be mitigated.

- Hermeneutic consistency: Filmer’s readings violate ordinary language. He treats singular statements to Adam as to all mankind, plural grants in Genesis 1 as to Adam alone, and joint words to Noah and his sons as to Noah alone.

- Scope: At most the verse grounds conjugal, not political, authority; otherwise every husband would be a monarch. The phrase “thy desire shall be to thy husband” is too ambiguous to bear Filmer’s claim.

- Conclusion: The two texts Filmer cites (Gen 1:28; Gen 3:16) establish dominion over animals and wives’ subordination, not absolute political sovereignty “as large as all the acts” of Adam’s will. Assertions without proof can be denied.
