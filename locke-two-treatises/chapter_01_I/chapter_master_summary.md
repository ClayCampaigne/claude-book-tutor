<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke opens by denouncing slavery and expressing astonishment that Englishmen could defend it. He identifies Sir Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha as the most prominent contemporary defense of absolute monarchy and thus the chief target of his critique. After a careful reading, Locke concludes that Filmer’s case is feeble—“a rope of sand”—and wholly inadequate to establish the universal subjection of mankind.

Locke distills Filmer’s system into a few core claims: all legitimate government is absolute monarchy; no one is born free; therefore people can neither choose their governors nor their form of government; princes rule by a divine right that traces back to Adam, who was supposedly an absolute monarch, with all princes inheriting his authority. This doctrine, Locke argues, flatters princes while stripping people of their natural freedom, opening the door to tyranny and oppression. Yet it also paradoxically unsettles existing thrones: if all but Adam’s true heir are born slaves to that heir alone, then most reigning princes lack any legitimate title, and everyone’s allegiance is owed elsewhere.

Locke insists that neither Scripture nor reason warrants such unlimited submission to another’s will. He emphasizes the novelty of the “jure divino” claim for absolute monarchy, noting that even prominent royalist writers like Heyward, Blackwood, and Barclay affirmed natural liberty and equality and did not deny that political power ultimately rests on the consent of free and equal persons. By contrast, Filmer’s doctrine represents a recent and dangerous innovation, one that English divines such as Sibthorp and Manwaring helped to propagate with harmful effects in practice.

Locke’s declared purpose is to scrutinize and dismantle Filmer’s argument, which has gained fashionable currency among advocates of absolute power. By exposing its biblical and rational failings, and by showing its pernicious political implications, Locke seeks to reassert natural freedom and the foundations of legitimate, limited government.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke opens by condemning slavery and expressing astonishment that Englishmen defend it; he targets Sir Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha as the leading defense of absolute monarchy.
- After careful reading, Locke deems Filmer’s arguments weak (“a rope of sand”) and insufficient to justify universal subjection.
- He identifies Filmer’s core system: (1) all legitimate government is absolute monarchy; (2) no one is born free; therefore people cannot choose governors or forms of government, and princes rule by divine right; Adam was an absolute monarch, and all princes inherit this status.
- Locke argues this doctrine flatters princes but denies natural freedom, thereby enabling tyranny and oppression; paradoxically, it also destabilizes princes’ titles by making all (except Adam’s heir) born slaves subject to that heir.
- He insists neither Scripture nor reason supports unlimited subjection to another’s will.
- He notes the novelty of “jure divino” absolute monarchy; even royalist writers (Heyward, Blackwood, Barclay) affirmed natural liberty and equality.
- He cites Sibthorp and Manwaring as early promoters of this doctrine’s harmful effects.
- Purpose stated: to scrutinize and dismantle Filmer’s argument, which has become fashionable among advocates of absolute power.
