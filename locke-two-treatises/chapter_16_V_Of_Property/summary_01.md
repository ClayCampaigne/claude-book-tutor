- Starting point: God gave the earth “to the children of men” in common (by reason and revelation), yet use requires appropriation. Mere common ownership is useless unless individuals can make particular things theirs.

- Principle of original acquisition: Each person owns his body and labor. When someone removes a thing from the common by mixing his labor with it (gathering fruit, drawing water, cutting turf, digging ore, catching fish, killing game, pursuing a hare), he adds something that is his and thereby makes it his property—without needing the express consent of all commoners.

- Constraints (“Lockean provisos”):
  - Spoilage limit: One may appropriate only as much as one can use “to any advantage of life” before it spoils; nothing is made to be wasted.
  - Enough-and-as-good: Appropriation is just only where enough and as good is left in common for others; under early abundance this left no injury.

- Land follows the same rule: Tilling, planting, improving, and enclosing by labor make land one’s property; God’s command to “subdue the earth” links dominion to cultivation. This did not wrong others while abundant land remained.

- Distinguish compact commons: Where land is held common by civil law (e.g., English commons), enclosure requires consent because the common is by positive compact, not natural.

- Scope and evolution: Early and even now in “vacant” places, labor-based appropriation yields modest, non-injurious holdings. Larger, enduring inequalities arise later from the invention of money and tacit consent to value it—a development Locke will explain next.
