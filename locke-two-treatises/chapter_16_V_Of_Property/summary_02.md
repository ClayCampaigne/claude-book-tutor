- Land’s value comes chiefly from labor, not mere extent. Even with today’s population, the “enough-and-as-good” condition could have held under the original rule “as much as one can use,” were it not for money and the tacit agreement to value it, which (by consent) introduced larger holdings—soon to be explained.

- Labor increases the common stock: cultivated land yields at least 10x (often nearer 100x) what the same land left waste produces. Hence an encloser who lives off 10 improved acres effectively “gives” 90 acres’ worth of product to mankind compared with leaving 100 acres uncultivated.

- Spoilage limit applies to land: enclosure confers title only so far as one actually uses the produce before it perishes; unused, rotting produce or pasture leaves that portion effectively waste and open to others.

- Early pattern: individuals took what they could use (e.g., Cain tilling while leaving enough pasture for Abel). As families and stocks grew, holdings expanded with need, but fixed property in land arose only after incorporation into cities and by consent—setting territorial bounds and domestic property laws. Patriarchal wandering (Abraham, Lot, Esau) shows much land remained common and claim followed use.

- Against Adamic private dominion: labor creates distinct titles and overbalances community of land because labor constitutes the vast majority of value (9/10, even 99/100) in goods like bread, wine, and cloth; nature provides mostly low-value materials until industry transforms them, including all embedded tool and transport labor.

- Political implication: populous, industrious improvement beats vast idle dominions; good government secures liberty and encourages honest industry.

- Later, communities and leagues mutually renounced natural common claims, positively partitioning the earth; yet where peoples have not joined the money-consent, large tracts still lie waste/common. Useful goods perish; precious metals/gems have value by agreement; each has right to as much as he can use and to what his labor alters.
