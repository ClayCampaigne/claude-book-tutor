<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke begins from the premise that God gave the earth to mankind in common; yet common ownership is useless unless individuals may appropriate particular things for use. The principle of original acquisition is labor: each person owns his body and work, so when he gathers fruit, draws water, hunts, fishes, or digs ore, he mixes his labor with what is common and makes it his own without needing the express consent of all others.

This natural title is bounded by two provisos. First, spoilage: one may take only so much as one can use to the advantage of life before it perishes; wasting is forbidden. Second, enough-and-as-good: appropriation is just only where enough and as good is left for others—conditions easily met in the early abundance of the world. Gifts or barter of perishables prevent waste and remain within right.

The same rule applies to land. Tilling, planting, improving, and enclosing by labor make land one’s property, for God’s command to subdue the earth links dominion to cultivation. Title extends only so far as one can use the produce before it spoils; unused or rotting produce leaves the rest effectively waste and open to others. Where land is common by civil compact (as with English commons), enclosure requires consent because the common there is by positive law, not nature.

Labor supplies the chief value of things—nine tenths, even ninety-nine hundredths in bread, wine, cloth—so labor both overbalances any original community of materials and enlarges the common stock. Ten acres well improved yield ten to a hundred times more than a hundred acres left waste; in effect, the industrious encloser benefits mankind.

Historically, people first took what they could use (Cain tilling with pasture enough for Abel); fixed territorial property arose later by consent. Durable valuables—metals, gems, shells—gain worth by agreement; their use as money relaxes the spoilage limit and, by tacit consent, permits unequal, lasting estates even outside civil society. Yet the root remains: labor begins title, use bounds it; within governments, positive laws further define and regulate property.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Starting point: God gave the earth “to the children of men” in common (by reason and revelation), yet use requires appropriation. Mere common ownership is useless unless individuals can make particular things theirs.

- Principle of original acquisition: Each person owns his body and labor. When someone removes a thing from the common by mixing his labor with it (gathering fruit, drawing water, cutting turf, digging ore, catching fish, killing game, pursuing a hare), he adds something that is his and thereby makes it his property—without needing the express consent of all commoners.

- Constraints (“Lockean provisos”):
  - Spoilage limit: One may appropriate only as much as one can use “to any advantage of life” before it spoils; nothing is made to be wasted.
  - Enough-and-as-good: Appropriation is just only where enough and as good is left in common for others; under early abundance this left no injury.

- Land follows the same rule: Tilling, planting, improving, and enclosing by labor make land one’s property; God’s command to “subdue the earth” links dominion to cultivation. This did not wrong others while abundant land remained.

- Distinguish compact commons: Where land is held common by civil law (e.g., English commons), enclosure requires consent because the common is by positive compact, not natural.

- Scope and evolution: Early and even now in “vacant” places, labor-based appropriation yields modest, non-injurious holdings. Larger, enduring inequalities arise later from the invention of money and tacit consent to value it—a development Locke will explain next.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Land’s value comes chiefly from labor, not mere extent. Even with today’s population, the “enough-and-as-good” condition could have held under the original rule “as much as one can use,” were it not for money and the tacit agreement to value it, which (by consent) introduced larger holdings—soon to be explained.

- Labor increases the common stock: cultivated land yields at least 10x (often nearer 100x) what the same land left waste produces. Hence an encloser who lives off 10 improved acres effectively “gives” 90 acres’ worth of product to mankind compared with leaving 100 acres uncultivated.

- Spoilage limit applies to land: enclosure confers title only so far as one actually uses the produce before it perishes; unused, rotting produce or pasture leaves that portion effectively waste and open to others.

- Early pattern: individuals took what they could use (e.g., Cain tilling while leaving enough pasture for Abel). As families and stocks grew, holdings expanded with need, but fixed property in land arose only after incorporation into cities and by consent—setting territorial bounds and domestic property laws. Patriarchal wandering (Abraham, Lot, Esau) shows much land remained common and claim followed use.

- Against Adamic private dominion: labor creates distinct titles and overbalances community of land because labor constitutes the vast majority of value (9/10, even 99/100) in goods like bread, wine, and cloth; nature provides mostly low-value materials until industry transforms them, including all embedded tool and transport labor.

- Political implication: populous, industrious improvement beats vast idle dominions; good government secures liberty and encourages honest industry.

- Later, communities and leagues mutually renounced natural common claims, positively partitioning the earth; yet where peoples have not joined the money-consent, large tracts still lie waste/common. Useful goods perish; precious metals/gems have value by agreement; each has right to as much as he can use and to what his labor alters.

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- In regions outside the “money-consent,” vast tracts remain common and underused; this scarcity of durable stores of value keeps holdings small because most truly useful goods perish if not consumed.

- Property by labor persists: one owns what one gathers or improves, but the spoilage limit binds—taking more than one can use before it rots “robs others.” Gifting or bartering perishable goods prevents waste and remains within right.

- Introducing durable valuables (metals, gems, shells)—whose worth rests on consent rather than necessity—lets people exchange surplus perishables for non-perishing stores. Hoarding such durable items violates no one’s right because nothing spoils; excess is measured by waste, not by size of holdings.

- Hence money arises as a lasting, scarce medium accepted by mutual consent. It relaxes the practical spoilage constraint and enables continued accumulation: different industry levels yield unequal estates that can now be preserved and enlarged through exchange for money.

- Illustrative island case: without any suitable money, even with abundant land and stock, there is no reason to enclose or amass more than one’s family can use; with money, the same people will enlarge possessions.

- Since gold and silver get value by consent (with labor largely measuring that value), mankind tacitly agreed to disproportionate, unequal property—possible even outside civil society. Within governments, positive laws further regulate and determine property.

- Originally, labor began title and its use bounded it, leaving little room for dispute: right matched convenience, and over-appropriation was both useless and dishonest.
