- In regions outside the “money-consent,” vast tracts remain common and underused; this scarcity of durable stores of value keeps holdings small because most truly useful goods perish if not consumed.

- Property by labor persists: one owns what one gathers or improves, but the spoilage limit binds—taking more than one can use before it rots “robs others.” Gifting or bartering perishable goods prevents waste and remains within right.

- Introducing durable valuables (metals, gems, shells)—whose worth rests on consent rather than necessity—lets people exchange surplus perishables for non-perishing stores. Hoarding such durable items violates no one’s right because nothing spoils; excess is measured by waste, not by size of holdings.

- Hence money arises as a lasting, scarce medium accepted by mutual consent. It relaxes the practical spoilage constraint and enables continued accumulation: different industry levels yield unequal estates that can now be preserved and enlarged through exchange for money.

- Illustrative island case: without any suitable money, even with abundant land and stock, there is no reason to enclose or amass more than one’s family can use; with money, the same people will enlarge possessions.

- Since gold and silver get value by consent (with labor largely measuring that value), mankind tacitly agreed to disproportionate, unequal property—possible even outside civil society. Within governments, positive laws further regulate and determine property.

- Originally, labor began title and its use bounded it, leaving little room for dispute: right matched convenience, and over-appropriation was both useless and dishonest.
