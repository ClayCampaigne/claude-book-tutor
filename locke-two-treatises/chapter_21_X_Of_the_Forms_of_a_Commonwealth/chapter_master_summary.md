<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter explains how the form of government arises once individuals unite into a political society. By entering a commonwealth, the people—acting by the majority—hold the community’s supreme power. They may keep the lawmaking authority in their own hands and appoint executors themselves, producing a “perfect democracy.” They may instead entrust the legislative to a select few and their successors, forming an oligarchy. Or they may vest it in a single person, yielding a monarchy, which is hereditary if passed to that person’s heirs, or elective if granted for life with the power reverting to the people to choose anew. They may also distribute powers among different hands, creating mixed or compound constitutions as they judge best.

The core principle is that the governmental form is defined solely by where the supreme power—the legislative—is placed. Only the supreme power can make laws; an inferior cannot prescribe rules to a superior. Therefore, the locus of legislative authority settles the species of government. Moreover, when the community grants the legislative to a person or body for life or a set term, that grant can naturally expire and revert to the people. At that point, the community may reassign the legislative elsewhere, thereby lawfully changing the form of government without breaching its own foundational authority.

Finally, the chapter clarifies terminology. “Commonwealth” is used broadly to mean any independent political community (the Latin civitas), regardless of whether its government is democratic, oligarchic, monarchical, or mixed. This inclusive use avoids confusion that might arise from restricting the term to a particular regime type. Across all forms, the constant is that the people, in forming society, originally hold the supreme power and may dispose of the legislative as they see fit, and, upon reversion, may alter its disposition to refit the commonwealth’s frame.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Starting point: Upon forming a political society, the majority holds the community’s whole (supreme) power. They may:
  - Retain lawmaking and appoint executives themselves → a perfect democracy.
  - Convey the legislative to a few (and their heirs/successors) → an oligarchy.
  - Convey it to one → a monarchy; if to him and heirs → hereditary; if to him for life with reversion to the people (who then nominate anew) → elective monarchy.
  - Create mixed/compound forms by distributing powers as they judge good.

- Core principle: The form of government is determined solely by where the supreme power—the legislative—is placed. Only the supreme can make laws; an inferior cannot prescribe to a superior. Grants of the legislative for life or a term may revert to the community, which may then re-dispose it and thereby lawfully alter the form of government.

- Terminology: “Commonwealth” here means any independent political community (Latin civitas), not specifically a democracy or any particular form. Locke adopts this broad usage to avoid ambiguity.
