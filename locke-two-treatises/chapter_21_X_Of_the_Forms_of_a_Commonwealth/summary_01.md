- Starting point: Upon forming a political society, the majority holds the community’s whole (supreme) power. They may:
  - Retain lawmaking and appoint executives themselves → a perfect democracy.
  - Convey the legislative to a few (and their heirs/successors) → an oligarchy.
  - Convey it to one → a monarchy; if to him and heirs → hereditary; if to him for life with reversion to the people (who then nominate anew) → elective monarchy.
  - Create mixed/compound forms by distributing powers as they judge good.

- Core principle: The form of government is determined solely by where the supreme power—the legislative—is placed. Only the supreme can make laws; an inferior cannot prescribe to a superior. Grants of the legislative for life or a term may revert to the community, which may then re-dispose it and thereby lawfully alter the form of government.

- Terminology: “Commonwealth” here means any independent political community (Latin civitas), not specifically a democracy or any particular form. Locke adopts this broad usage to avoid ambiguity.
