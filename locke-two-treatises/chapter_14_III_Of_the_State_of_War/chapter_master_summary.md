<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke distinguishes sharply between the state of nature and the state of war. The state of nature is a condition of peace, goodwill, and mutual aid governed by reason, even without a common superior. By contrast, the state of war begins when someone, by settled design or by using force without right, aims at another’s life or claims absolute power over him. Such a person sets himself outside the common law of reason and may be met with lethal defensive force, as one would resist a dangerous beast.

Attempting to enslave is itself a declaration of war. Because liberty is the chief safeguard of self-preservation, anyone who would take another’s freedom can be presumed ready to take everything else, including life. This principle holds both in the state of nature and within established societies.

Hence one may lawfully kill a violent thief who seeks to overpower him, even if the thief does not explicitly threaten death. By denying the innocent time to appeal to a common judge, the aggressor introduces a state of war. The decisive factor is not merely the act of theft but the use of force that suspends recourse to impartial adjudication.

A common judge with authority and effective enforcement ends a state of war once force ceases and legal remedy is available. Where there is no such appeal, or where justice is perverted to shield violence, the state of war persists. In that condition, the innocent retain a right to destroy the aggressor until security and peace are restored.

When earthly remedies fail, Locke allows an “appeal to heaven,” invoking Jephthah as an example: individuals must judge in conscience whether such an appeal is warranted, remaining accountable to God. The ever-present risk that private judgment could perpetuate conflict is precisely why people enter civil society—to place the resolution of force under settled law and impartial judgment, securing peace without perpetual recourse to violent self-help.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke defines the state of war as a condition of enmity and destruction initiated when someone, by settled intent or by using force without right, seeks another’s life or absolute power over him. Such a design places the aggressor outside the common law of reason and may be met with lethal defensive force, as with dangerous beasts.
- Attempting to enslave—seeking absolute power over another without his consent—is itself a declaration of war, since freedom is the safeguard of preservation; whoever would take away liberty can be presumed ready to take everything else, including life. This holds both in the state of nature and within society.
- Hence one may kill a violent thief who seeks to overpower him, even absent an explicit threat to life, because the aggressor denies time to appeal to a common judge and introduces a state of war.
- Distinction: State of nature = peace, goodwill, mutual aid under reason without a common superior. State of war = force or declared force where no effective appeal exists. A common judge ends the state of war once force ceases; without such appeal (or where justice is perverted to shield violence), the state of war persists, giving the innocent a right to destroy the aggressor until peace and security are offered.
- Lacking earthly remedy, sufferers have an “appeal to heaven” (Jephthah’s example). Each must judge in conscience whether such an appeal is warranted, accountable to God. This need to avoid perpetual war motivates entering civil society.
