- Locke defines the state of war as a condition of enmity and destruction initiated when someone, by settled intent or by using force without right, seeks another’s life or absolute power over him. Such a design places the aggressor outside the common law of reason and may be met with lethal defensive force, as with dangerous beasts.
- Attempting to enslave—seeking absolute power over another without his consent—is itself a declaration of war, since freedom is the safeguard of preservation; whoever would take away liberty can be presumed ready to take everything else, including life. This holds both in the state of nature and within society.
- Hence one may kill a violent thief who seeks to overpower him, even absent an explicit threat to life, because the aggressor denies time to appeal to a common judge and introduces a state of war.
- Distinction: State of nature = peace, goodwill, mutual aid under reason without a common superior. State of war = force or declared force where no effective appeal exists. A common judge ends the state of war once force ceases; without such appeal (or where justice is perverted to shield violence), the state of war persists, giving the innocent a right to destroy the aggressor until peace and security are offered.
- Lacking earthly remedy, sufferers have an “appeal to heaven” (Jephthah’s example). Each must judge in conscience whether such an appeal is warranted, accountable to God. This need to avoid perpetual war motivates entering civil society.
