- Locke clarifies that “Honour thy father and mother” enjoins a natural filial duty to private parents, not political obedience to magistrates. Since parents, as subjects, hold no sovereign authority, this command cannot ground civil subjection; nor can princes absolve children of this duty. What that duty entails will be examined later.
- Having refuted all Filmerian pillars—creation, Genesis 1:28, Genesis 3:16, begetting, and the fifth commandment—Locke concludes natural freedom and equality stand. Only an explicit divine appointment or a person’s own consent can justify any one’s supremacy. Even leading royalists (Hayward, Blackwood, Barclay) admit this.
- Locke then exposes Filmer’s contradictions: Filmer both makes Adam the absolute, sole monarch and gives Adam’s children paternal power over their own children. This must be natural paternal (not delegated) power, as shown by Filmer’s wording, its limitation to “their own children,” and Scripture’s silence on any commission.
- The result is incoherent: two simultaneous “absolute, unlimited” authorities (Adam over all; each father over his children), or a meaningless “subordination” of one absolute to another. Either paternal power confers royal authority—making every father a king—or it doesn’t—voiding Adam’s sovereignty.
- Locke catalogs Filmer’s shifting seat of “fatherhood” (Adam, parents, heirs, prime fathers, kings, governors, elective kings, even usurpers), revealing it as an empty device that destabilizes legitimate governments and licenses tyranny and usurpation.
