<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke tackles Filmer’s final and most crucial claim: that “fatherhood” by begetting gives Adam—and by extension all patriarchs—sovereign, absolute authority over their children, reducing every person to a subject of his begetter. Filmer, leaning on Grotius, simply asserts this entails life-and-death power akin to a master over slaves. Locke answers that generation confers no right to destroy: giving existence does not imply a title to take it away. In any case, humans do not properly “give life”; only God is maker and giver, since men neither design the body nor infuse the rational soul. And even if “making” grounded dominion, mothers would hold at least equal title, having supplied and nourished the embryo. Scripture nowhere grants the father a superior generative dignity; it routinely pairs “father and mother.”

Nor can custom supply the missing right. Practices such as exposing, selling, castrating, or even eating children—found among pagans and, in the case of child sacrifice, even among Israelites—are condemned by Scripture as murder and idolatry. Fashion and antiquity corrupt; nature and divine law require preservation of offspring.

Locke then shows Filmer’s scriptural keystone—“Honour thy father”—rests on a misquotation that excises “and thy mother.” Across the Bible, children owe honour and obedience to both parents equally; sometimes the mother is named first, and in severe cases father and mother jointly judge, signaling shared, not monarchical, authority. If the fifth commandment founded sovereignty, it would make every father (and mother) a ruler, multiplying monarchs and dissolving any single supremacy. The duty binds irrespective of civil power; magistrates cannot discharge it, so it cannot be political subjection or an alienable power transferred to princes.

Having dismantled Filmer’s pillars—creation, Genesis 1:28, Genesis 3:16, begetting, and the fifth commandment—Locke reaffirms natural freedom and equality. Only explicit divine appointment or personal consent can justify supremacy, as even leading royalists concede. He closes by exposing Filmer’s contradictions: Adam is said to be absolute over all, yet each father supposedly has absolute power over his own children—an incoherent multiplication of “absolutes.” Filmer’s ever-shifting seat of “fatherhood” (from Adam to parents, heirs, kings, governors, even usurpers) reveals an empty device that destabilizes lawful government and excuses tyranny.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke turns to Filmer’s last pillar: that Adam (and all patriarchs) held sovereign, royal authority over children by “fatherhood,” making every person born a subject of his begetter. Filmer cites Grotius (generatione jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos) but supplies no limit or proof, simply asserting this yields absolute, life-and-death power akin to masters over slaves.
- Locke’s rebuttal:
  - Begetting does not confer a right to destroy: giving something does not entail a right to take it away.
  - Fathers do not “give life” in the relevant sense; only God is maker and giver of life. Humans neither design nor understand the structure, operations, or the infusion of the rational soul; thus only God’s “maker” title could ground such dominion.
  - Even if “making” grounded authority, mothers would hold at least equal title, having furnished and nourished the embryo’s substance; so no exclusive paternal sovereignty follows.
  - Filmer’s claim that God gave man sovereignty over woman as the “nobler, principal agent in generation” lacks any scriptural basis; Scripture attributes begetting to “father and mother.”
- Appeals to practice (exposing/selling children, historical cannibalism, or even child sacrifices among Israelites) cannot found right: custom and fashion often corrupt; nature and divine law require preservation of offspring, and God condemns such acts as murder.
- Conclusion: “Fatherhood by begetting” provides no warrant for absolute political dominion, and Filmer’s unsupported assertions cannot enslave all mankind by birth.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Custom cannot ground right: even Israel practiced child sacrifice, yet Scripture condemns it as “innocent blood” and idolatry (Ps. 106), showing that fashionable or ancient practices (selling, castrating, exposing, even eating children) do not legitimate paternal power.
- Filmer’s scriptural proof misquotes the fifth commandment by omitting “and thy mother.” Locke argues this distortion is central: throughout Scripture, father and mother are inseparably joined in filial duty.
- Extensive citations (Exod. 20; 21; Lev. 19; 20; Deut. 21; 27; Prov.; Isa. 45; Ezek. 22; Zech. 13; Matt. 15; Eph. 6) show:
  - Children owe honour/obedience to both parents equally; sometimes the mother is named first.
  - In severe cases (Zech. 13:3), father and mother jointly exercise judgment, evidencing shared authority, not paternal monarchy.
- Therefore the fifth commandment:
  - Does not confer “monarchical” paternal sovereignty; if it did, mothers would co-rule, and every father would be a sovereign, multiplying monarchs and destroying one-supreme rule.
  - Binds independently of civil authority; magistrates cannot discharge a child from honouring either parent, proving this duty is not political subjection.
  - Cannot be reconciled with Filmer’s claim that the magistrate possesses all paternal authority; if alienated to the prince, natural parents would retain none, contradicting the command’s universal, inalienable duty.
- Conclusion: “Honour thy father and thy mother” prescribes a natural, perpetual filial duty distinct from political obedience, thus cannot found absolute civil dominion by fatherhood and in fact refutes Filmer’s paternal-monarchy thesis.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Locke clarifies that “Honour thy father and mother” enjoins a natural filial duty to private parents, not political obedience to magistrates. Since parents, as subjects, hold no sovereign authority, this command cannot ground civil subjection; nor can princes absolve children of this duty. What that duty entails will be examined later.
- Having refuted all Filmerian pillars—creation, Genesis 1:28, Genesis 3:16, begetting, and the fifth commandment—Locke concludes natural freedom and equality stand. Only an explicit divine appointment or a person’s own consent can justify any one’s supremacy. Even leading royalists (Hayward, Blackwood, Barclay) admit this.
- Locke then exposes Filmer’s contradictions: Filmer both makes Adam the absolute, sole monarch and gives Adam’s children paternal power over their own children. This must be natural paternal (not delegated) power, as shown by Filmer’s wording, its limitation to “their own children,” and Scripture’s silence on any commission.
- The result is incoherent: two simultaneous “absolute, unlimited” authorities (Adam over all; each father over his children), or a meaningless “subordination” of one absolute to another. Either paternal power confers royal authority—making every father a king—or it doesn’t—voiding Adam’s sovereignty.
- Locke catalogs Filmer’s shifting seat of “fatherhood” (Adam, parents, heirs, prime fathers, kings, governors, elective kings, even usurpers), revealing it as an empty device that destabilizes legitimate governments and licenses tyranny and usurpation.
