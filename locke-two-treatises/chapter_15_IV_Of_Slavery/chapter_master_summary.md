<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter distinguishes liberty from license and identifies the only condition in which slavery can be legitimate. Natural liberty is the freedom of persons in the state of nature: to be subject to no human superior and bound only by the law of nature. Civil liberty is the freedom of persons in political society: to be subject only to a legislature established by their consent and bound only by standing, known laws made under that trust. In both cases, freedom means having the right to act where the rule is silent and being protected from subjection to another’s arbitrary, uncertain will; it is not permission to do whatever one pleases.

Because freedom from absolute, arbitrary power is inseparable from the basic right of self-preservation, it cannot be alienated. No one has a rightful power over his own life to give or sell; therefore, no person can consent to become the absolute property of another or grant someone a right to kill him. One cannot transfer more authority than one possesses.

From this it follows that true slavery is nothing but a continued state of war, where one person is under the absolute, arbitrary power of another who has a right to take his life. Such a condition can arise only when a person has forfeited his life by crime. A lawful conqueror may then spare the criminal and use him in service, since the right to kill has been acquired. Yet the captive retains the option to end this condition by resisting and accepting the death he had forfeited. Conversely, when parties strike a compact that sets limits and reciprocal obligations, the state of war is suspended and with it slavery; the relationship becomes one of civil obligation under rules, not arbitrary will.

Scriptural examples of “self-sale” among the Jews illustrate servitude, not absolute slavery: masters lacked the power to kill or even to maim at will, and injuries such as the loss of an eye or tooth secured the servant’s freedom (Exodus 21).

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Defines liberty:
  - Natural liberty: free from any superior human power; bound only by the law of nature.
  - Civil liberty: subject only to a legislature established by consent; bound only by standing, known laws made under that trust. Freedom is a right to act where the rule is silent, and not to be subject to another’s arbitrary, uncertain will. It is not a license to do whatever one pleases.

- Freedom from absolute, arbitrary power is inseparable from self-preservation and is inalienable:
  - No one has a right over his own life to give or sell; therefore one cannot consent to be absolutely enslaved or grant another a right to kill him.
  - One cannot convey more power than one possesses.

- True slavery equals a continued state of war:
  - A criminal who has forfeited his life may be spared and used in service by the lawful conqueror; the captive can end it by resisting and accepting death.
  - If a compact sets limits and mutual obligations, the war—and thus slavery—ceases while it endures.

- Biblical “self-sale” among the Jews was servitude, not absolute slavery: masters lacked power to kill or even maim at will; injuries (eye, tooth) freed the servant (Exod. 21).
