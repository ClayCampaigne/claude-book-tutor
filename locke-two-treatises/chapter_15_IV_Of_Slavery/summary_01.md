- Defines liberty:
  - Natural liberty: free from any superior human power; bound only by the law of nature.
  - Civil liberty: subject only to a legislature established by consent; bound only by standing, known laws made under that trust. Freedom is a right to act where the rule is silent, and not to be subject to another’s arbitrary, uncertain will. It is not a license to do whatever one pleases.

- Freedom from absolute, arbitrary power is inseparable from self-preservation and is inalienable:
  - No one has a right over his own life to give or sell; therefore one cannot consent to be absolutely enslaved or grant another a right to kill him.
  - One cannot convey more power than one possesses.

- True slavery equals a continued state of war:
  - A criminal who has forfeited his life may be spared and used in service by the lawful conqueror; the captive can end it by resisting and accepting death.
  - If a compact sets limits and mutual obligations, the war—and thus slavery—ceases while it endures.

- Biblical “self-sale” among the Jews was servitude, not absolute slavery: masters lacked power to kill or even maim at will; injuries (eye, tooth) freed the servant (Exod. 21).
