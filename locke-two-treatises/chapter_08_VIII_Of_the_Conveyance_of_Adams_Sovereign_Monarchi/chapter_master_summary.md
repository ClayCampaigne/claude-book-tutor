<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Chapter 8 begins by asking, on Filmer’s own premises, how Adam’s supposed sovereignty could ever pass to later rulers. Locke gathers and orders Filmer’s scattered—and mutually inconsistent—answers about conveyance. Sometimes Filmer says posterity could hold nothing but by Adam’s grant or succession; elsewhere he insists there is always one man in every multitude with a natural right to be king as Adam’s next heir; at other points he allows that all kings are either fathers, heirs of such fathers, or usurpers; then he adds that fatherly empire is both hereditary and yet alienable by patent and seizable; and finally he concludes that it does not matter how the crown is obtained—by election, donation, succession, or any other means—since what makes a man properly king is simply ruling with “supreme power.”

For Locke, this last move explodes Filmer’s Adamic foundation. If the mere possession of “supreme power” is what confers rightful kingship, then any successful seizer—Cromwell, Masaniello, or whoever can hold the sword—is legitimate. The category of usurpation disappears, because success retroactively purifies title. Filmer’s theory thus slides from a principled claim about inherited paternal authority to a vacuous rule that might makes right, contradicting his own insistence that right must be traced to Adam.

Having exposed these contradictions, Locke announces a more methodical test. He proposes to examine, one by one, the only routes Filmer himself mentions—inheritance, grant, usurpation, and election—to see whether any could plausibly transmit Adam’s authority or impose on subjects a duty of obedience, even if one were to concede for argument’s sake that Adam had been an absolute monarch. The chapter’s task, then, is to show that none of these modes can deliver what Filmer needs: a determinate, rightful title in later rulers grounded in Adamic patriarchy, rather than in mere possession or post hoc success.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
Chapter 8 opens by testing how, on Filmer’s own terms, Adam’s alleged sovereignty could be transmitted to later rulers. Locke collates Filmer’s scattered, conflicting accounts of conveyance:
- Grant or succession: posterity could hold nothing except by Adam’s permission or succession.
- Inheritance only: every multitude has one man with a natural right to be king as Adam’s next heir.
- Inheritance or usurpation: all kings are fathers, heirs of such fathers, or usurpers.
- Inheritance, grant (alienable by patent), or usurpation: fatherly empire is hereditary yet alienable and seizable.
- Finally, any means at all: election, donation, succession, or “any other means” suffice, since “the manner of government by supreme power” makes one properly king, not the way the crown is obtained.

Locke says this last claim detonates Filmer’s Adamic foundation: if ruling with “supreme power” alone makes a king, any successful seizer (e.g., Cromwell, Masaniello) is rightful, erasing the very notion of usurpation. After noting these open contradictions, Locke proposes to examine, one by one, whether inheritance, grant, usurpation, or election can plausibly convey Adam’s authority or yield a right to subjects’ obedience—even if Adam had truly been an absolute monarch.
