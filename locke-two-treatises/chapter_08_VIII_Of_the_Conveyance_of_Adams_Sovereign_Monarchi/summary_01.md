Chapter 8 opens by testing how, on Filmer’s own terms, Adam’s alleged sovereignty could be transmitted to later rulers. Locke collates Filmer’s scattered, conflicting accounts of conveyance:
- Grant or succession: posterity could hold nothing except by Adam’s permission or succession.
- Inheritance only: every multitude has one man with a natural right to be king as Adam’s next heir.
- Inheritance or usurpation: all kings are fathers, heirs of such fathers, or usurpers.
- Inheritance, grant (alienable by patent), or usurpation: fatherly empire is hereditary yet alienable and seizable.
- Finally, any means at all: election, donation, succession, or “any other means” suffice, since “the manner of government by supreme power” makes one properly king, not the way the crown is obtained.

Locke says this last claim detonates Filmer’s Adamic foundation: if ruling with “supreme power” alone makes a king, any successful seizer (e.g., Cromwell, Masaniello) is rightful, erasing the very notion of usurpation. After noting these open contradictions, Locke proposes to examine, one by one, whether inheritance, grant, usurpation, or election can plausibly convey Adam’s authority or yield a right to subjects’ obedience—even if Adam had truly been an absolute monarch.
