<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter distinguishes usurpation from both lawful succession and foreign conquest by defining it as a “domestic conquest”: the seizure of offices or powers that belong by right to someone else. Unlike conquest, which may raise separate questions of title over lands or peoples taken in war, usurpation never carries right, because the usurper occupies authority to which another is entitled.

Usurpation, strictly speaking, alters only the personnel of government, not its constitution. The frame, laws, and offices may remain intact while an unauthorized person slips into their exercise. When the intruder not only takes an office without title but also wields powers beyond what that office lawfully allows, the wrong compounds: tyranny is added to usurpation.

A lawful commonwealth depends on two foundations: the form of government and the rule-bound designation of who shall hold its powers. Both ultimately derive from the people as the original source of political authority. To leave the appointment of rulers undefined or unsettled would be a kind of anarchy, for it would abandon the orderly transmission of authority that makes civil society possible.

Accordingly, every legitimate constitution provides procedures for conferring offices and transferring power. Entry into any part of the public power by means other than those prescribed by law lacks rightful title. Even if the outward form of the constitution is preserved, the unauthorized holder has no claim to the obedience of the people simply by occupying the place.

Nor can time or succession cleanse the defect. Neither the usurper nor those who follow him acquire a rightful title merely by possession. Right emerges only when the people are genuinely free to consent and do in fact expressly ratify the authority previously taken. Until such free, explicit consent confirms the power, the usurper remains without right, and obedience to him is not owed by the standards of a lawful commonwealth.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Usurpation is “domestic conquest”: seizing offices or powers that rightfully belong to another. Unlike conquest, an usurper never has right, because he holds what someone else is entitled to.
- As usurpation, it changes only the persons in office, not the government’s form or rules; if the usurper also exceeds the lawful scope of those offices, it adds tyranny to usurpation.
- In every lawful commonwealth, designating who shall bear rule is as essential as defining the form of government, and this designation originally derives from the people. Lacking rules to determine the personnel of rule is akin to anarchy.
- Therefore all constitutions have lawful procedures for appointing and conveying authority. Anyone who enters into the exercise of any part of power by means other than those prescribed by law has no right to obedience, even if the constitutional form remains.
- Neither the usurper nor his successors can gain a rightful title until the people are free to consent and do in fact expressly consent to confirm the power previously usurped.
