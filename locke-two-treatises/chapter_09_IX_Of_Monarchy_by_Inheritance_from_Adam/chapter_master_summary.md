<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke begins by insisting that political obedience presupposes a known, rightful title to rule; where no such title can be identified, power is indistinguishable from piracy. Thus, even if Adam once held absolute monarchy, that fact matters now only if his authority was (1) transmissible at his death and (2) actually conveyed to present rulers. If either fails, no existing government can claim Adamic right.

Filmer’s preferred path of conveyance is inheritance, grounded in Adam’s property from God’s donation and in his fatherhood by begetting. Locke answers with a general rule: heirs can inherit a right only if they inherit the reason on which it was founded. A purely personal, positive grant to Adam would lapse at his death unless expressly extended to heirs. More fundamentally, property in creatures arises by natural law from the God-given drive to self-preservation, which authorizes all to use what life requires. This common title belonged equally to Adam’s children even during his life; it yields no superior heir and no sovereignty-from-property.

Particular estates, once appropriated, do naturally descend—but because of parents’ duty to maintain offspring and the natural inclination to propagate. Children therefore have a natural claim to their parents’ goods at death, typically preferred over a father’s claim; if a son dies without issue, the father or nearest kin succeed; absent kin, property reverts to the community. None of this can found dominion, since property serves the proprietor’s private benefit, whereas government exists for the public good; the titles are different in kind.

Succession must mirror the original title: rule begun by consent descends by consent; a divine grant requires further divine designation (as with Saul to David), not primogeniture; a title by begetting cannot descend, since the personal act of begetting is incommunicable. Nor is paternal power alienable: it arises from care and relation, as Locke’s foster-father example shows, and cannot be transferred by sale or grant. Filmer’s appeal to nature for the heir’s title contradicts itself: the law of nature gives paternal power to the begetter, not to an eldest brother who begot no one—no more than conjugal power could pass to a non-husband. Hence, even granting Adam such powers, they died with him; each father holds his own paternal authority by begetting. Locke next asks whether Adam even had a determinate heir.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke argues that obedience requires knowing who has rightful authority; without identifiable title, power collapses into mere force (pirates vs princes). Thus, even if Adam had absolute monarchy, it matters now only if: (1) Adam’s power was transmissible beyond his death; and (2) current rulers hold it by a valid conveyance. If either fails, Adamic right cannot ground present governments.

- Filmer’s preferred conveyance is inheritance, built on two bases: Adam’s private dominion (property) from God’s donation (Gen. 1:28) and fatherhood from begetting. Locke’s principle: heirs can inherit a right only if they inherit the reason on which it was founded. A purely personal, positive grant to Adam would revert to God at his death; it would not vest in an heir unless expressly granted to heirs.

- More fundamentally, property in creatures arises by natural law from the God-given drive for self-preservation and reason (“the voice of God”), which authorizes use of things necessary for life. This title belongs equally to all, including Adam’s children during his life; hence no heir’s superiority and no sovereignty-from-property.

- Particular estates, once appropriated, naturally descend to children. This natural inheritance stems from a second implanted desire—to propagate—and from parents’ duty to maintain offspring; children thus have a natural right to their parents’ goods upon death. The “debt” to one’s father is subordinate to provision for one’s own children, but if a son dies without issue, the father has a natural claim to inherit; failing that, succession ascends/descends among nearest kin.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Children’s right to inherit arises from their natural claim to maintenance and education from parents; this preference can outweigh a father’s claim, but if a son dies without issue, the father has a natural right to inherit. If no kin exist, property reverts to the community (to the magistrate in civil society; to common in the state of nature).

- This grounding shows Adam’s putative property could not yield sovereignty: after his death, all children would have a joint, equal title to share, divide, or hold in common; no one could claim the whole or any political dominion tied to it.

- Property and government have different ends and titles: property exists for the proprietor’s benefit and may be consumed; government exists for the governed, wielding the sword for public good. Thus, children’s title to goods cannot translate into a title to rule.

- Succession must follow the original title: if first rule came by consent, consent determines descent; if by God’s positive grant, only a further divine direction can convey it (e.g., Saul to David, not by primogeniture). If by begetting, it cannot descend, since one cannot inherit the personal act of begetting—paternal (like conjugal) power is non-inheritable.

- Adamic “sovereignty,” whether from property or fatherhood, would die with him. Nor can paternal power be alienated: a father may forfeit but cannot transfer it; paternal authority arises from care and relation, as shown by a foster-father case. Primogeniture has no natural or divine right to either estate or power.

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Locke illustrates non-transferability of paternal power with a case: a negligent father sells/gives away his child; the buyer neglects him; a third man rescues, raises, and provides for the child. The child’s chief duty and subjection are owed to the foster-father who actually performed paternal care. The natural father may have forfeited much of his claim but cannot transfer it; the purchaser acquires no filial right by the father’s grant. Paternal authority arises from performing the paternal office, not alienation.

- Therefore, if (as Filmer says) paternal power rests solely on begetting, it can neither be transferred nor inherited: one who did not beget cannot acquire a right whose sole title is begetting.

- Filmer tacitly appeals to the law of nature for the heir’s title. Locke shows this is self-contradictory: the law of nature gives paternal power to the begetter; it cannot also give it to the firstborn over siblings he did not beget. If the eldest may inherit without the only qualifying reason, so might the youngest or even a stranger—there is no reason left to distinguish claimants.

- By the same logic, claiming a non-husband could hold conjugal power is as absurd as claiming a non-begetter could inherit paternal power.

- Conclusion: even granting Adam such powers, they were non-heritable and ended with him. Each father has his own paternal authority by begetting, not by derivation from Adam. Locke next asks whether Adam even had an identifiable heir.
