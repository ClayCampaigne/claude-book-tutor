- Locke argues that obedience requires knowing who has rightful authority; without identifiable title, power collapses into mere force (pirates vs princes). Thus, even if Adam had absolute monarchy, it matters now only if: (1) Adam’s power was transmissible beyond his death; and (2) current rulers hold it by a valid conveyance. If either fails, Adamic right cannot ground present governments.

- Filmer’s preferred conveyance is inheritance, built on two bases: Adam’s private dominion (property) from God’s donation (Gen. 1:28) and fatherhood from begetting. Locke’s principle: heirs can inherit a right only if they inherit the reason on which it was founded. A purely personal, positive grant to Adam would revert to God at his death; it would not vest in an heir unless expressly granted to heirs.

- More fundamentally, property in creatures arises by natural law from the God-given drive for self-preservation and reason (“the voice of God”), which authorizes use of things necessary for life. This title belongs equally to all, including Adam’s children during his life; hence no heir’s superiority and no sovereignty-from-property.

- Particular estates, once appropriated, naturally descend to children. This natural inheritance stems from a second implanted desire—to propagate—and from parents’ duty to maintain offspring; children thus have a natural right to their parents’ goods upon death. The “debt” to one’s father is subordinate to provision for one’s own children, but if a son dies without issue, the father has a natural claim to inherit; failing that, succession ascends/descends among nearest kin.
