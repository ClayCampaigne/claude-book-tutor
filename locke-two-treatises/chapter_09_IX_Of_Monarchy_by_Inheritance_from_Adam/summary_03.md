- Locke illustrates non-transferability of paternal power with a case: a negligent father sells/gives away his child; the buyer neglects him; a third man rescues, raises, and provides for the child. The child’s chief duty and subjection are owed to the foster-father who actually performed paternal care. The natural father may have forfeited much of his claim but cannot transfer it; the purchaser acquires no filial right by the father’s grant. Paternal authority arises from performing the paternal office, not alienation.

- Therefore, if (as Filmer says) paternal power rests solely on begetting, it can neither be transferred nor inherited: one who did not beget cannot acquire a right whose sole title is begetting.

- Filmer tacitly appeals to the law of nature for the heir’s title. Locke shows this is self-contradictory: the law of nature gives paternal power to the begetter; it cannot also give it to the firstborn over siblings he did not beget. If the eldest may inherit without the only qualifying reason, so might the youngest or even a stranger—there is no reason left to distinguish claimants.

- By the same logic, claiming a non-husband could hold conjugal power is as absurd as claiming a non-begetter could inherit paternal power.

- Conclusion: even granting Adam such powers, they were non-heritable and ended with him. Each father has his own paternal authority by begetting, not by derivation from Adam. Locke next asks whether Adam even had an identifiable heir.
