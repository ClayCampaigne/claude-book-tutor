- Children’s right to inherit arises from their natural claim to maintenance and education from parents; this preference can outweigh a father’s claim, but if a son dies without issue, the father has a natural right to inherit. If no kin exist, property reverts to the community (to the magistrate in civil society; to common in the state of nature).

- This grounding shows Adam’s putative property could not yield sovereignty: after his death, all children would have a joint, equal title to share, divide, or hold in common; no one could claim the whole or any political dominion tied to it.

- Property and government have different ends and titles: property exists for the proprietor’s benefit and may be consumed; government exists for the governed, wielding the sword for public good. Thus, children’s title to goods cannot translate into a title to rule.

- Succession must follow the original title: if first rule came by consent, consent determines descent; if by God’s positive grant, only a further divine direction can convey it (e.g., Saul to David, not by primogeniture). If by begetting, it cannot descend, since one cannot inherit the personal act of begetting—paternal (like conjugal) power is non-inheritable.

- Adamic “sovereignty,” whether from property or fatherhood, would die with him. Nor can paternal power be alienated: a father may forfeit but cannot transfer it; paternal authority arises from care and relation, as shown by a foster-father case. Primogeniture has no natural or divine right to either estate or power.
