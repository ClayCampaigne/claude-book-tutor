- Civil recognition of majority: Commonwealths delay oaths and public obligations until people can “act like freemen,” underscoring Locke’s rule that liberty depends on reason. Turning a child loose before he has reason is to abandon him to a brutish state; this need grounds parental authority.

- Nature and limits of parental power: It is a duty for the child’s good—guiding body and mind, and, if needed, requiring work for subsistence. It is shared equally by father and mother; it attaches to care and education, not to begetting alone. If the father abandons care, he loses this authority; a foster-father may hold it. Cross-cultural cases (polyandry; matrilineal custody on divorce; widowed mothers) show it is not a peculiarly paternal dominion. Parents have no legislative/magisterial power, no power over a child’s life, property earned or gifted, or liberty after the “years of discretion” (supported by “leave father and mother”).

- Distinguish obedience from honor: Temporary tutelage ends at maturity and is alienable (e.g., apprenticeship); lifelong honor—respect, aid, non-injury—remains but does not entail command. Degrees of honor vary with parental care.

- Political vs paternal power: They are distinct in foundation and end; subjects retain parental authority, and princes owe filial duty.

- Inheritance leverage: A father’s power to distribute estate binds adult children only via incentives. Accepting inherited land voluntarily carries the civil conditions annexed to it; it does not naturally bind posterity to the father’s compact or government.
