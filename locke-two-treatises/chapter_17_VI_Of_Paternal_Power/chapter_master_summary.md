<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke dismantles the doctrine of “paternal power” by showing the name itself misleads: both reason and Scripture vest authority in parents jointly—father and mother—so the proper term is “parental power.” Because the fundamental authority over children is shared and fiduciary, it cannot ground one-person political absolutism.

He clarifies natural equality: it concerns jurisdiction, not social precedence. No adult has innate dominion over another merely by age, birth, virtue, or merit. Children are not born in this equality, though born to it. Parental authority is temporary, justified by the child’s want of reason, and wanes as reason grows—like swaddling clothes that fall away.

The basis and scope of parental power lie in a natural duty to preserve, nourish, and educate God’s workmanship during nonage. The law of mankind is reason; because law must be promulgated by reason, those without its use are not yet under that law and so are not yet free. Law enlarges, rather than restricts, liberty: it frees one from another’s arbitrary will without licensing harm. Thus parents rightly direct a child’s will until he attains reason; at maturity he is as free as his father, with no residual parental claim over his life, liberty, or estate.

Civil practice mirrors this: majorities mark capacity; guardians act where parents fail; those who never attain reason remain under care for their own good. Even an infant sovereign must be under tutors without losing right; tutelage prepares, it does not transfer, sovereignty. Parental power is a duty for the child’s good—governing body and mind, and requiring labor if need be. It is shared equally, attached to care and education rather than begetting; it can pass to a foster parent or be forfeited by neglect. It confers no legislative or magisterial power and ends at the years of discretion, though lifelong honor—respect, aid, non-injury—remains distinct from obedience.

Political power is different in foundation and end. Any leverage a father has over adult children stems only from estate conditions. Acceptance of inherited land is a voluntary act that submits one to its attached civil obligations; refusal leaves one free. Early “family monarchies” arose not from paternal right but from consent: adult children, for convenience and safety, let fathers exercise the executive power each freeman holds under the law of nature. Habit and affection made this seem natural, and such household rule evolved into diverse polities. But the historical fact that fathers often ruled no more proves a natural political right than it would prove that all princes are priests.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke critiques the term “paternal power” as misleading; both reason and Scripture give parents—father and mother—an equal share in authority over children. Calling it “parental power” exposes the flaw in patriarchal absolutism: if the fundamental authority is shared, it cannot ground one-person monarchy.

- Equality clarified: natural equality concerns jurisdiction—no one has inherent dominion over another. Social precedence (age, virtue, merit, birth, benefits) does not confer political rule. Children are not born in this equality, though born to it: parental authority is temporary, like swaddling clothes, and loosens as reason develops.

- Basis and scope of parental power: it arises from a natural duty to preserve, nourish, and educate children—God’s workmanship—during nonage. The law governing mankind is reason; because law must be promulgated by reason, those without the use of reason (infants) are not yet under that law and so are not yet free.

- Law enlarges, not restricts, freedom; liberty is freedom from others’ arbitrary will, not license. Hence parental governance directs the child’s will until he attains reason; at maturity, the son is as free as the father, with no residual dominion over his life, liberty, or estate.

- Civil parallels: legal majorities (e.g., 21) mark capacity; guardians act when parents fail to appoint tutors. Those who never attain reason (lunatics, idiots) never become freemen and remain under care for their good.

- Even an infant “sovereign” (e.g., Adam’s heir) would be under tutors without losing his right; such tutelage prepares, but does not transfer, sovereignty.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Civil recognition of majority: Commonwealths delay oaths and public obligations until people can “act like freemen,” underscoring Locke’s rule that liberty depends on reason. Turning a child loose before he has reason is to abandon him to a brutish state; this need grounds parental authority.

- Nature and limits of parental power: It is a duty for the child’s good—guiding body and mind, and, if needed, requiring work for subsistence. It is shared equally by father and mother; it attaches to care and education, not to begetting alone. If the father abandons care, he loses this authority; a foster-father may hold it. Cross-cultural cases (polyandry; matrilineal custody on divorce; widowed mothers) show it is not a peculiarly paternal dominion. Parents have no legislative/magisterial power, no power over a child’s life, property earned or gifted, or liberty after the “years of discretion” (supported by “leave father and mother”).

- Distinguish obedience from honor: Temporary tutelage ends at maturity and is alienable (e.g., apprenticeship); lifelong honor—respect, aid, non-injury—remains but does not entail command. Degrees of honor vary with parental care.

- Political vs paternal power: They are distinct in foundation and end; subjects retain parental authority, and princes owe filial duty.

- Inheritance leverage: A father’s power to distribute estate binds adult children only via incentives. Accepting inherited land voluntarily carries the civil conditions annexed to it; it does not naturally bind posterity to the father’s compact or government.

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Children are by nature as free as their parents and may choose what society to join. Any political obligation via inheritance is voluntary: accepting ancestral land entails submitting to the government and conditions attached to that land; refusing the estate avoids those ties.

- A father’s leverage over adult children and their political allegiance stems from control of inheritance (rewards/conditions), not from any natural right of fatherhood—no more than a foreign benefactor’s estate could bind an heir to that country’s laws.

- Paternal command ends with minority; lifelong honor and support owed to parents do not include a power to govern, legislate, penalize, or control an adult child’s property or actions.

- Origin of early “family monarchies”: in sparse settlements, grown children, by tacit consent, allowed the father to exercise alone the executive power of the law of nature that each freeman holds. This was consent-based, not paternal right—shown by the father’s authority to punish a stranger in his household, which cannot derive from fatherhood.

- Habit, affection, few disputes, and greater security made this consent “almost natural,” and such household rule gradually yielded hereditary or elective kingdoms under varied constitutions.

- De facto early rule by fathers does not prove a natural political right; by the same logic, all princes would also have to be priests.
