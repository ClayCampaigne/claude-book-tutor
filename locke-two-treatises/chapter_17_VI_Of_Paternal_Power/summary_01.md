- Locke critiques the term “paternal power” as misleading; both reason and Scripture give parents—father and mother—an equal share in authority over children. Calling it “parental power” exposes the flaw in patriarchal absolutism: if the fundamental authority is shared, it cannot ground one-person monarchy.

- Equality clarified: natural equality concerns jurisdiction—no one has inherent dominion over another. Social precedence (age, virtue, merit, birth, benefits) does not confer political rule. Children are not born in this equality, though born to it: parental authority is temporary, like swaddling clothes, and loosens as reason develops.

- Basis and scope of parental power: it arises from a natural duty to preserve, nourish, and educate children—God’s workmanship—during nonage. The law governing mankind is reason; because law must be promulgated by reason, those without the use of reason (infants) are not yet under that law and so are not yet free.

- Law enlarges, not restricts, freedom; liberty is freedom from others’ arbitrary will, not license. Hence parental governance directs the child’s will until he attains reason; at maturity, the son is as free as the father, with no residual dominion over his life, liberty, or estate.

- Civil parallels: legal majorities (e.g., 21) mark capacity; guardians act when parents fail to appoint tutors. Those who never attain reason (lunatics, idiots) never become freemen and remain under care for their good.

- Even an infant “sovereign” (e.g., Adam’s heir) would be under tutors without losing his right; such tutelage prepares, but does not transfer, sovereignty.
