- Children are by nature as free as their parents and may choose what society to join. Any political obligation via inheritance is voluntary: accepting ancestral land entails submitting to the government and conditions attached to that land; refusing the estate avoids those ties.

- A father’s leverage over adult children and their political allegiance stems from control of inheritance (rewards/conditions), not from any natural right of fatherhood—no more than a foreign benefactor’s estate could bind an heir to that country’s laws.

- Paternal command ends with minority; lifelong honor and support owed to parents do not include a power to govern, legislate, penalize, or control an adult child’s property or actions.

- Origin of early “family monarchies”: in sparse settlements, grown children, by tacit consent, allowed the father to exercise alone the executive power of the law of nature that each freeman holds. This was consent-based, not paternal right—shown by the father’s authority to punish a stranger in his household, which cannot derive from fatherhood.

- Habit, affection, few disputes, and greater security made this consent “almost natural,” and such household rule gradually yielded hereditary or elective kingdoms under varied constitutions.

- De facto early rule by fathers does not prove a natural political right; by the same logic, all princes would also have to be priests.
