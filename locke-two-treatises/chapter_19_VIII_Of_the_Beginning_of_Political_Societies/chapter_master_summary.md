<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Political society begins only by consent. Free, equal, and independent individuals agree to unite into one community so they may enjoy their lives and estates securely and peaceably, and defend one another. This incorporation creates a single body politic whose acts must follow the will of the majority; unanimity is impracticable, and without majority rule the society could not act and would dissolve, emptying the original compact of meaning. The compact itself is minimal: merely agreeing to unite under one government. By that act each person obliges himself to abide by majority determinations, and any number of freemen “capable of a majority” may found a lawful commonwealth.

Objections from history fail. Early times left few records—government commonly precedes letters, and nations forget their beginnings—but we still find origins in voluntary union: Rome and Venice, Spartan colonists under Palantus, and many New World peoples who lived without fixed kings, choosing leaders as need required. Paternal subjection does not cancel later political liberty to unite. That many early governments rested in one hand reflects consent and convenience, not paternal dominion: households habituated people to single-person rule exercised with care; monarchy was the simplest form for inexperienced ages; and small, poor, equal conditions produced few disputes and chiefly required defense. Early kingship was essentially military leadership—the captain-general chosen for public safety—much as among many American Indians or in biblical Israel under the judges and first kings. Only later, as luxury and ambition grew, did rulers pursue separate interests, prompting people to recall first principles and devise restraints; none held monarchy by divine or paternal right.

Nor are all born subject. If birth under dominion bound absolutely, only one lawful prince could exist—contradicted by the proliferation of small commonwealths and frequent lawful secessions. Birth does not bind: a parent’s compact cannot oblige adult children, though accepting an inherited estate may carry local conditions. Consent comes in two forms: express consent makes one a permanent member until the government dissolves or ejects him; tacit consent arises from enjoying any part of the dominion and binds only during that enjoyment. Land within a commonwealth remains annexed to its jurisdiction; mere residence and protection impose obedience but not membership, and foreigners may live under a government without becoming its members absent explicit consent.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Political societies begin only by consent: free, equal, independent individuals agree to unite into one community for secure, peaceful enjoyment of their property and mutual defense.
- Incorporation creates one body politic; by reason and the law of nature, the majority’s will is the act of the whole. Unanimity is impracticable; without majority rule the society cannot act and would dissolve, making the original compact meaningless.
- The compact needed is minimal: merely agreeing to unite under one government. By that, each member obliges himself to abide by majority determinations. Any number of freemen “capable of a majority” can found a lawful government.
- Objection 1 (no historical instances): Sparse records of the state of nature are expected—government precedes letters; peoples often forget their origins. Yet history shows beginnings by voluntary union: Rome and Venice; New World peoples who lived without fixed kings, choosing leaders as needed (Josephus Acosta); the Spartan colonists with Palantus.
- Paternal subjection does not negate later political liberty to unite (argued earlier).
- While many early governments were in one hand, this reflects consent and convenience, not paternal right: families often trusted fathers’ natural executive power; when unfit or when families combined, they chose the ablest. Petty monarchies were commonly elective.
- Why monarchy first: habituation from childhood to one ruler; its simplicity; and early ignorance of the need to restrain prerogative—none of which implies inherent paternal dominion.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Why early societies chose monarchy by consent: Household rule habituated people to single-person authority exercised with care and affection. Monarchy was the simplest, most obvious form for inexperienced ages that had not yet suffered or foreseen abuses of prerogative. Simple, poor conditions with small, equal holdings produced few disputes and little need for elaborate laws or offices; the chief collective need was defense.

- Military leadership as the core of early kingship: Communities, bound by familiarity and trust, chiefly sought protection against external force and thus chose the wisest/bravest war leader to be their ruler. Ethnographic example: many American Indian “kings” command absolutely in war but have modest authority in peace; councils or the people decide peace/war. Biblical Israel shows the same: judges and first kings were essentially captains-general (Jephthah, Gideon, Abimelech so-called “king,” Saul and David anointed/recognized as “captain”). Kingship was thus entrusted for the public safety.

- Evolution and later restraint: Whether family authority drifted into succession or several families united under a general, early trust and public-spirited “nursing fathers” sustained infant commonwealths. With later ambition and luxury, rulers sought separate interests, prompting people to reexamine governmental origins and devise checks. No one then held monarchy jure divino or from paternal right.

- Rebuttal to “all are born under government” objection: If anyone born under dominion can found a lawful monarchy, then by parity all can freely found new governments; otherwise only one lawful prince exists—identify him. History shows frequent secessions and new commonwealths, disproving paternal sovereignty and universal, inescapable subjection. Being born under established polities no more cancels natural freedom than being born in the woods; ancestral consent cannot alone bind posterity absolutely.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Against paternal/universal monarchy: The historical proliferation of small commonwealths proves people were free to withdraw from families/polities and found new governments; otherwise there would have been one universal monarchy.

- Birth does not bind: Being born under an established polity no more cancels natural freedom than being born in the woods. A parent’s compact cannot bind adult children; the father may attach conditions to his estate, obliging heirs who accept it to join that community, which creates the appearance of “natural” subjection because each person’s consent occurs separately at majority.

- Government practice confirms this: Children are born subjects of no country. Example: an English subject’s child born in France is not automatically a subject of either crown; at majority he is free to choose his political society.

- Consent types:
  - Express consent (positive engagement/compact) makes one a permanent member, bound until the government dissolves or publicly cuts him off.
  - Tacit consent arises from enjoying any part of a government’s dominions—owning land, lodging briefly, even traveling on highways—and binds only during that enjoyment. One may quit possession and emigrate or found anew in free, unoccupied places (vacuis locis).

- Incorporation annexes both person and possessions: land within a commonwealth remains under its laws; later holders take it subject to that jurisdiction.

- Mere residence/ protection imposes obedience but not membership; foreigners may live lifelong under a government without becoming members absent explicit consent.
