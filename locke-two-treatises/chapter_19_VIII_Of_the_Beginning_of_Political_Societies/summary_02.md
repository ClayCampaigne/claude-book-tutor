- Why early societies chose monarchy by consent: Household rule habituated people to single-person authority exercised with care and affection. Monarchy was the simplest, most obvious form for inexperienced ages that had not yet suffered or foreseen abuses of prerogative. Simple, poor conditions with small, equal holdings produced few disputes and little need for elaborate laws or offices; the chief collective need was defense.

- Military leadership as the core of early kingship: Communities, bound by familiarity and trust, chiefly sought protection against external force and thus chose the wisest/bravest war leader to be their ruler. Ethnographic example: many American Indian “kings” command absolutely in war but have modest authority in peace; councils or the people decide peace/war. Biblical Israel shows the same: judges and first kings were essentially captains-general (Jephthah, Gideon, Abimelech so-called “king,” Saul and David anointed/recognized as “captain”). Kingship was thus entrusted for the public safety.

- Evolution and later restraint: Whether family authority drifted into succession or several families united under a general, early trust and public-spirited “nursing fathers” sustained infant commonwealths. With later ambition and luxury, rulers sought separate interests, prompting people to reexamine governmental origins and devise checks. No one then held monarchy jure divino or from paternal right.

- Rebuttal to “all are born under government” objection: If anyone born under dominion can found a lawful monarchy, then by parity all can freely found new governments; otherwise only one lawful prince exists—identify him. History shows frequent secessions and new commonwealths, disproving paternal sovereignty and universal, inescapable subjection. Being born under established polities no more cancels natural freedom than being born in the woods; ancestral consent cannot alone bind posterity absolutely.
