- Against paternal/universal monarchy: The historical proliferation of small commonwealths proves people were free to withdraw from families/polities and found new governments; otherwise there would have been one universal monarchy.

- Birth does not bind: Being born under an established polity no more cancels natural freedom than being born in the woods. A parent’s compact cannot bind adult children; the father may attach conditions to his estate, obliging heirs who accept it to join that community, which creates the appearance of “natural” subjection because each person’s consent occurs separately at majority.

- Government practice confirms this: Children are born subjects of no country. Example: an English subject’s child born in France is not automatically a subject of either crown; at majority he is free to choose his political society.

- Consent types:
  - Express consent (positive engagement/compact) makes one a permanent member, bound until the government dissolves or publicly cuts him off.
  - Tacit consent arises from enjoying any part of a government’s dominions—owning land, lodging briefly, even traveling on highways—and binds only during that enjoyment. One may quit possession and emigrate or found anew in free, unoccupied places (vacuis locis).

- Incorporation annexes both person and possessions: land within a commonwealth remains under its laws; later holders take it subject to that jurisdiction.

- Mere residence/ protection imposes obedience but not membership; foreigners may live lifelong under a government without becoming members absent explicit consent.
