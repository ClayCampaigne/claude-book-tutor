Locke targets Filmer’s twin “fountains” of sovereignty—fatherhood and property—and shows they are mutually inconsistent and contradict Filmer’s own claim that Genesis 3:16 is the original grant of government. Even granting Filmer the strongest premises (Adam as sole proprietor of the earth and absolute paterfamilias), Locke asks what happens at Adam’s death. Property might (if proved) pass to the eldest son, but paternal power cannot descend by inheritance, since it arises only from begetting; an elder brother did not beget his siblings and so cannot hold natural dominion over them. Thus, on Filmer’s terms, Adam’s two titles immediately split: the heir gets property; each son with children gets paternal authority over his own issue. Sovereignty is thereby divided, creating uncertainty about who is supreme.

Using Filmer’s own examples (via Grotius), Locke shows the dilemma in practice: Abel’s private dominion exempts him from Cain’s supposed sovereignty, or else property is irrelevant to government. The same problem recurs with Noah’s division among Shem, Ham, and Japhet: either regal power follows property (destroying fatherhood as its source), or the eldest’s heirship nullifies Noah’s grants, or two independent supremes arise—precisely the absurdity Filmer elsewhere denounces. Locke concludes the fusion of fatherhood and property cannot ground monarchical title; he will next examine alleged transmissions of Adam’s sovereignty.
