<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
In this chapter Locke dismantles Filmer’s claim that political sovereignty springs from two “fountains,” fatherhood and property, showing that the two titles undercut each other and even contradict Filmer’s own appeal to Genesis 3:16 as the original grant of government. Locke grants Filmer every advantage—suppose Adam were both sole proprietor of the earth and absolute paterfamilias—and asks what follows at Adam’s death. Property, if it could be proved, might pass to the eldest son. But paternal power cannot descend by inheritance, because it is a natural authority arising only from begetting; an elder brother did not beget his siblings and so cannot have a natural dominion over them. The consequence on Filmer’s terms is immediate fission: Adam’s heir takes the estate, while each son who becomes a father acquires paternal authority only over his own issue. Sovereignty is thereby divided, and no single, determinate supreme can be identified.

Locke presses the dilemma with Filmer’s own cases (borrowed via Grotius). If Cain held sovereignty as Adam’s political heir, then Abel’s private dominion over his flocks would place him beyond Cain’s authority; if it did not, property is irrelevant to political power. The same knot appears after the Flood: Noah’s partition among Shem, Ham, and Japhet forces a choice. Either regal power follows property—which abandons fatherhood as the source of rule—or the eldest’s right of heirship vitiates Noah’s grants, or else there emerge multiple independent supremes, the very absurdity Filmer elsewhere condemns. In each scenario, trying to yoke fatherhood to property generates competing, incompatible titles, not a clear line of monarchs. Locke concludes that the fusion cannot ground monarchical right; it either dissolves into divided jurisdictions or denies Filmer’s scriptural starting point. Having exposed this incoherence, Locke turns next to examine the alleged transmissions of Adam’s sovereignty—by succession, donation, or other conveyances—to show that none can produce a legitimate, determinate, and absolute political authority.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
Locke targets Filmer’s twin “fountains” of sovereignty—fatherhood and property—and shows they are mutually inconsistent and contradict Filmer’s own claim that Genesis 3:16 is the original grant of government. Even granting Filmer the strongest premises (Adam as sole proprietor of the earth and absolute paterfamilias), Locke asks what happens at Adam’s death. Property might (if proved) pass to the eldest son, but paternal power cannot descend by inheritance, since it arises only from begetting; an elder brother did not beget his siblings and so cannot hold natural dominion over them. Thus, on Filmer’s terms, Adam’s two titles immediately split: the heir gets property; each son with children gets paternal authority over his own issue. Sovereignty is thereby divided, creating uncertainty about who is supreme.

Using Filmer’s own examples (via Grotius), Locke shows the dilemma in practice: Abel’s private dominion exempts him from Cain’s supposed sovereignty, or else property is irrelevant to government. The same problem recurs with Noah’s division among Shem, Ham, and Japhet: either regal power follows property (destroying fatherhood as its source), or the eldest’s heirship nullifies Noah’s grants, or two independent supremes arise—precisely the absurdity Filmer elsewhere denounces. Locke concludes the fusion of fatherhood and property cannot ground monarchical title; he will next examine alleged transmissions of Adam’s sovereignty.
