Chapter 22 (chunk 2) reinforces and grounds the limits on the legislative as a delegated, fiduciary trust.

- Nondelegation justified: The legislative’s authority comes from the people “by a positive voluntary grant” to make laws, not to make legislators. Therefore it cannot transfer or relocate lawmaking power; only the people can constitute or reassign the legislative. Any attempt to place lawmaking elsewhere exceeds its commission.

- Universal bounds (from society’s trust and the law of God and nature) apply to every form of government:
  1) Rule of law: govern by promulgated, standing, general laws—one rule for rich and poor; no ad hoc variation.
  2) Public good: laws must ultimately aim at the people’s good.
  3) No taxation without consent: taxes require the people’s consent, given by themselves or their deputies/representatives. Locke notes the procedural focus where a legislature is standing, and where the people reserve parts of the legislative to deputies chosen from time to time—consent in such cases must come through those deputies.
  4) Nondelegation: the legislative must not/cannot transfer lawmaking power beyond where the people have placed it.
