Chapter 22 (chunk 1) sets the supremacy and strict limits of the legislative power as a fiduciary trust for the public good.

- Fundamental setup: The first positive law of any commonwealth is constituting the legislative; the first natural law governing even it is preservation of society and, as far as consistent with the public good, of every person. Only the constituted legislative can make laws because only it bears society’s consent; all obedience ultimately runs to it, and no oath to foreign or subordinate powers can override obedience to a legislative acting within its trust.

- Limits on the legislative:
  1) Not arbitrary or absolute: It can have no more power than individuals held in the state of nature; it may never destroy, enslave, or designedly impoverish. Natural law (the will of God; preservation of mankind) eternally binds legislators.
  2) No extemporary decrees: It must govern by promulgated, standing laws and known judges. Arbitrary rule defeats the very ends for which people left the state of nature.
  3) No taking of property without consent: Property is the end of government; taxation and charges require consent of the people (majority) by themselves or representatives. Even absolute military command cannot touch a soldier’s estate.
  4) Non-delegation: Lawmaking power, delegated by the people, cannot be transferred to other hands.

- Rule-of-law requirements: equal, established laws for rich and poor; laws aimed solely at the people’s good; no taxes without consent (especially guarding against perpetual or one-man legislatures).
