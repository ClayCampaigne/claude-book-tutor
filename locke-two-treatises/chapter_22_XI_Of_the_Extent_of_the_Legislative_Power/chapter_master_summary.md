<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Chapter 22 defines the legislative as both supreme in a commonwealth and strictly limited as a fiduciary trust for the public good. The first positive act of any society is to constitute its legislature; yet above it stands the first natural law—the preservation of society, and, as far as consistent with the public good, of every person. Because the legislative alone bears the people’s consent, only it can make binding laws; all civil obedience ultimately runs to it. No oath to foreign or subordinate powers can cancel obedience to a legislature that acts within its commission.

Locke then draws firm bounds to this supreme power. First, it is not arbitrary or absolute. The legislative can have no more right than individuals possessed in the state of nature: it may not destroy, enslave, or designedly impoverish. The law of nature—the will of God aiming at the preservation of mankind—eternally binds lawmakers. Second, it must govern by promulgated, standing, general laws administered by known judges. Extemporary decrees and ad hoc exceptions defeat the very ends for which people left the state of nature; there must be one rule for rich and poor alike.

Third, it may not take anyone’s property without consent, since the preservation of property is a central end of government. Taxes and public charges therefore require the people’s consent, given by themselves or by their representatives. This holds even under the strictest military discipline: command does not extend to a soldier’s estate. Procedurally, where there is a standing legislature, consent runs through it; where the people reserve parts of the legislative to deputies chosen from time to time, consent must come through those deputies—a key guard against perpetual or one-man taxation.

Finally, the lawmaking power is nondelegable. The people granted the legislature authority to make laws, not to make legislators; it cannot transfer or relocate that power. These universal limits bind every form of government, securing rule of law, representation in taxation, and the public good against arbitrary dominion.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
Chapter 22 (chunk 1) sets the supremacy and strict limits of the legislative power as a fiduciary trust for the public good.

- Fundamental setup: The first positive law of any commonwealth is constituting the legislative; the first natural law governing even it is preservation of society and, as far as consistent with the public good, of every person. Only the constituted legislative can make laws because only it bears society’s consent; all obedience ultimately runs to it, and no oath to foreign or subordinate powers can override obedience to a legislative acting within its trust.

- Limits on the legislative:
  1) Not arbitrary or absolute: It can have no more power than individuals held in the state of nature; it may never destroy, enslave, or designedly impoverish. Natural law (the will of God; preservation of mankind) eternally binds legislators.
  2) No extemporary decrees: It must govern by promulgated, standing laws and known judges. Arbitrary rule defeats the very ends for which people left the state of nature.
  3) No taking of property without consent: Property is the end of government; taxation and charges require consent of the people (majority) by themselves or representatives. Even absolute military command cannot touch a soldier’s estate.
  4) Non-delegation: Lawmaking power, delegated by the people, cannot be transferred to other hands.

- Rule-of-law requirements: equal, established laws for rich and poor; laws aimed solely at the people’s good; no taxes without consent (especially guarding against perpetual or one-man legislatures).
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
Chapter 22 (chunk 2) reinforces and grounds the limits on the legislative as a delegated, fiduciary trust.

- Nondelegation justified: The legislative’s authority comes from the people “by a positive voluntary grant” to make laws, not to make legislators. Therefore it cannot transfer or relocate lawmaking power; only the people can constitute or reassign the legislative. Any attempt to place lawmaking elsewhere exceeds its commission.

- Universal bounds (from society’s trust and the law of God and nature) apply to every form of government:
  1) Rule of law: govern by promulgated, standing, general laws—one rule for rich and poor; no ad hoc variation.
  2) Public good: laws must ultimately aim at the people’s good.
  3) No taxation without consent: taxes require the people’s consent, given by themselves or their deputies/representatives. Locke notes the procedural focus where a legislature is standing, and where the people reserve parts of the legislative to deputies chosen from time to time—consent in such cases must come through those deputies.
  4) Nondelegation: the legislative must not/cannot transfer lawmaking power beyond where the people have placed it.
