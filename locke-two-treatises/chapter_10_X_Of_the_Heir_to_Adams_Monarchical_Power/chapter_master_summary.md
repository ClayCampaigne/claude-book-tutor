<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
In this chapter Locke targets Filmer’s foundational claim that political authority is natural and hereditary: in any multitude there is, by nature, one man who is king as Adam’s next heir, so that every person is either a born ruler or a born subject. Filmer insists this is always determinate—if Adam were now expiring, there would be exactly one rightful universal heir. Locke accepts this premise only to show it undoes the very thrones it aims to sanctify. Apply it to the princes of Europe and each reigning king faces countless rivals asserting a superior lineage from Adam; rather than stabilizing obedience, the doctrine multiplies pretenders and foments dispute.

Locke sharpens the point into a dilemma. If Adamic heirship is the necessary and sufficient title to sovereignty, then at any time only one man in the world can be a lawful king. All other rulers are usurpers who must abdicate, and no subject owes obedience to any government until that single, true heir is identified. But if lawful kingship can exist without Adamic descent, Filmer’s doctrine is irrelevant to political right and provides no ground for obedience.

Locke then shows the heir principle collapses on its own terms. If there is but one heir, subjects cannot possibly know whom to obey until his title is proven—an epistemic void that suspends all civil obligation. If, to avoid this, Filmer allows for multiple heirs or coheirs, parity of reasoning makes all Adam’s descendants heirs. Then all are kings and owe obedience to none, which dissolves government altogether.

Thus Filmer’s patriarchal theory either nullifies all existing governments or cannot justify any. By exposing its practical anarchism and logical incoherence, Locke concludes that Adamic heirship cannot ground political authority or obligation, clearing the way to seek a different, non-genealogical basis for legitimate rule.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Filmer claims it is “undeniable” that in any multitude there is one man who by nature is king of all as Adam’s next heir; thus every person is by nature either a king or a subject, and if Adam were now dying there would be exactly one rightful heir in the world.
- Locke shows this premise destabilizes all existing thrones: apply it to all current princes and you generate hundreds of rival “true” titles against every reigning king.
- He frames a decisive dilemma:
  - If Adamic heirship is the true, necessary title to sovereignty, then only one man can be a lawful king; all other rulers must resign, and no one owes obedience until that sole heir is identified.
  - If kings can be lawful without Adamic heirship, the doctrine is irrelevant to political right and obedience.
- Further, the heir principle collapses logically:
  - If there is but one heir, subjects cannot know whom to obey until his title is proved.
  - If multiple heirs are possible (coheirs), then by parity all Adam’s descendants are heirs—so all are kings and owe obedience to none.
- Thus Filmer’s heir doctrine either voids all government or is useless to justify it.
