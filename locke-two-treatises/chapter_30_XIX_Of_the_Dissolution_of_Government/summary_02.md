- Popular election is a property fence: representatives must be freely chosen and free to deliberate after hearing debate. Pre‑committing votes, packing assemblies with declared abettors of the executive’s will, and using rewards, punishments, or perverted law to destroy opponents plainly declare a design to subvert government and breach trust; anyone attempting this forfeits confidence and power.

- Objection (instability if people may refound legislatures) fails: peoples are slow to forsake old constitutions; English experience shows repeated returns to king–lords–commons. Revolutions arise not from trifling mismanagement but from a long train of abuses revealing a settled design against liberty.

- This doctrine deters rebellion by identifying true rebels: those who, by force, overturn law and the established legislative (including legislators who invade property) reintroduce a state of war. Removing or altering the legislative without popular authorization unties the social bond.

- Peace without lawful defense is submission to rapine; resisting unlawful force is like resisting robbers. People generally endure much; only manifest, generalized threats rouse them—and the blame lies with rulers who create those conditions.

- Even royalist Barclay concedes lawful popular self‑defense against a king’s intolerable tyranny over the whole or a notable part of the people (defense of present assaults, not punitive revenge), proving not all resistance is rebellion.
