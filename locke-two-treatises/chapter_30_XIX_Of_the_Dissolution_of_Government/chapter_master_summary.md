<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke distinguishes dissolving society from dissolving government. Society ends chiefly by conquest; once the community is broken, its government cannot subsist. Government, by contrast, dissolves from within when the legislative—the soul that unifies the body politic—is altered or disabled. Only those authorized by the people may make binding laws; usurpers’ edicts do not oblige, and the people may resist and constitute a new legislative.

In a mixed constitution of prince, nobles, and commons, the legislative is altered when the prince substitutes will for standing law, hinders the legislature from meeting or freely deliberating, corrupts the electoral frame by changing electors or methods without consent, or subjects the people to a foreign power. Because he commands force, treasure, offices, and can dissolve other parts, this guilt chiefly lies with the prince, though abettors share it. Government also dissolves when the executive abandons execution so laws cannot be enforced, reducing all to anarchy.

Breach of trust is the decisive criterion. Legislators who invade property or impose arbitrary dominion place themselves in a state of war with the people and forfeit authority; the executive likewise breaches trust by setting will above law, pre‑engaging electors, corrupting representatives, or “new‑modelling” elections. Popular election is a fence to property: representatives must be freely chosen and free to deliberate; packing assemblies, pre‑committing votes, and using rewards, punishments, or perverted law to crush opponents declare a design to subvert government and void confidence.

This doctrine deters rebellion by identifying true rebels—those who, by force, overturn law and the established legislative. People are slow to change and will endure much; revolutions arise from a long train of abuses revealing a settled design against liberty. Peace without lawful defense is submission to rapine; resistance to unlawful force is like resisting robbers.

Even royalist Barclay concedes lawful defense against intolerable tyranny and that a king “unkings” himself by designs to ruin the commonwealth or subject it to a foreign power. English authorities concur. Who judges breaches? The people. If rulers refuse adjudication, there is no earthly judge: the appeal to heaven lies. Upon forfeiture or lapse, supreme power reverts to the society to continue, reform, or reassign the legislative.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke distinguishes dissolving society from dissolving government. Society ends chiefly by foreign conquest; once the community is broken, its government cannot subsist.

- Internal dissolution occurs when the legislative—“the soul” that unifies the body politic—is altered or disabled. Only those authorized by the people may make binding laws; laws imposed by usurpers do not oblige, and the people may resist and constitute a new legislative.

- In a mixed constitution (hereditary executive with power to summon/dissolve, hereditary nobles, elected commons), the legislative is altered when:
  1) The prince substitutes his arbitrary will for standing laws, enforcing unauthorized rules.
  2) He prevents the legislature from meeting in due time or acting freely (debate, time to perfect measures).
  3) He changes electors or election methods without consent and against the common interest.
  4) He or the legislature subjects the people to a foreign power.

- Such dissolution is chiefly imputed to the prince, who commands force, treasure, and offices, and can dissolve other parts of the legislative; others share guilt if they abet or fail to oppose.

- Government also dissolves when the executive neglects/abandons execution so laws cannot be enforced—reducing all to anarchy.

- Upon dissolution, the people may erect a new legislative; they also have a right to prevent tyranny before it is complete.

- Breach of trust dissolves government: legislators who invade property or impose arbitrary dominion put themselves in a state of war with the people, forfeit authority, and power devolves back to the people.

- The executive likewise breaches trust by setting will above law, corrupting representatives, pre‑engaging electors, or “new‑modelling” elections—thereby subverting the very fountain of public security.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Popular election is a property fence: representatives must be freely chosen and free to deliberate after hearing debate. Pre‑committing votes, packing assemblies with declared abettors of the executive’s will, and using rewards, punishments, or perverted law to destroy opponents plainly declare a design to subvert government and breach trust; anyone attempting this forfeits confidence and power.

- Objection (instability if people may refound legislatures) fails: peoples are slow to forsake old constitutions; English experience shows repeated returns to king–lords–commons. Revolutions arise not from trifling mismanagement but from a long train of abuses revealing a settled design against liberty.

- This doctrine deters rebellion by identifying true rebels: those who, by force, overturn law and the established legislative (including legislators who invade property) reintroduce a state of war. Removing or altering the legislative without popular authorization unties the social bond.

- Peace without lawful defense is submission to rapine; resisting unlawful force is like resisting robbers. People generally endure much; only manifest, generalized threats rouse them—and the blame lies with rulers who create those conditions.

- Even royalist Barclay concedes lawful popular self‑defense against a king’s intolerable tyranny over the whole or a notable part of the people (defense of present assaults, not punitive revenge), proving not all resistance is rebellion.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Locke cites royalist Barclay, who concedes the people may lawfully resist a king’s “intolerable tyranny” to defend themselves, though he adds two limits: do it “with reverence” and without punishing the king. Locke rejects both: effective resistance requires counter‑force; once force without right creates a state of war, former relations of superiority dissolve, so the aggressor may be punished upon defeat.

- Barclay elsewhere admits two cases where a king “unkings” himself and may be resisted: (1) designs to ruin/overturn the commonwealth (e.g., Nero, Caligula), (2) making the kingdom dependent on a foreign power. Locke generalizes: wherever lawful authority ceases, the king ceases; this tracks Locke’s principle of breach of trust—failing to preserve the agreed form and the end of government (public good, preservation of property).

- Barclay also allows preemptive resistance to tyrannical designs; Locke infers neglect of the public good evidences such designs. The core wrong is loss of the people’s liberty, whether to domestic or foreign dominion.

- English authorities (Bilson, Bracton, Fortescue, Mirrour, Hooker) support forfeiture of princely power for breach of trust. Locke condemns the novel doctrine that reduces all government to absolute tyranny as dangerous to rulers and people alike.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Locke cites English authorities—Bilson, Bracton, Fortescue, the Mirrour, and especially Hooker—to affirm that princes can forfeit power and subjects’ obedience. He rebukes those who revere Hooker ecclesiastically yet deny his political premises, calling absolutist “civil policy” a novel, ruinous flattery of tyranny.

- Who judges breach of trust? The people. By the trustee analogy, the deputor retains power to dismiss a deputy who fails the trust; this holds with greater force where millions’ welfare is at stake. Where law is silent or doubtful on great matters, the proper umpire is the body of the people who first lodged the trust and can judge its extent.

- If rulers refuse popular adjudication, there is no earthly judge; a state of war ensues and the “appeal to heaven” applies. Each injured party must judge when to make that appeal.

- Reversion of power: The natural power each person gave to society never reverts to individuals while the society endures; it remains in the community. If the people have vested a perpetual legislature with authority to provide successors, that legislative does not revert during that government. But if the legislature is time‑limited, or authority is forfeited by miscarriages (breach of trust), the supreme power reverts to the society, which may act as supreme: continue the legislative in themselves, erect a new form, or reassign it under the old form to new hands.
