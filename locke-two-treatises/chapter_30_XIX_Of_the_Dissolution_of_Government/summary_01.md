- Locke distinguishes dissolving society from dissolving government. Society ends chiefly by foreign conquest; once the community is broken, its government cannot subsist.

- Internal dissolution occurs when the legislative—“the soul” that unifies the body politic—is altered or disabled. Only those authorized by the people may make binding laws; laws imposed by usurpers do not oblige, and the people may resist and constitute a new legislative.

- In a mixed constitution (hereditary executive with power to summon/dissolve, hereditary nobles, elected commons), the legislative is altered when:
  1) The prince substitutes his arbitrary will for standing laws, enforcing unauthorized rules.
  2) He prevents the legislature from meeting in due time or acting freely (debate, time to perfect measures).
  3) He changes electors or election methods without consent and against the common interest.
  4) He or the legislature subjects the people to a foreign power.

- Such dissolution is chiefly imputed to the prince, who commands force, treasure, and offices, and can dissolve other parts of the legislative; others share guilt if they abet or fail to oppose.

- Government also dissolves when the executive neglects/abandons execution so laws cannot be enforced—reducing all to anarchy.

- Upon dissolution, the people may erect a new legislative; they also have a right to prevent tyranny before it is complete.

- Breach of trust dissolves government: legislators who invade property or impose arbitrary dominion put themselves in a state of war with the people, forfeit authority, and power devolves back to the people.

- The executive likewise breaches trust by setting will above law, corrupting representatives, pre‑engaging electors, or “new‑modelling” elections—thereby subverting the very fountain of public security.
