- “Them” in Gen 1:26–28 denotes the human species and its individuals, not Adam alone. Dominion flows from the image of God—intellectual nature—shared by all humans; Psalm 8 confirms this as mankind’s, not Adam’s, prerogative.

- Filmer’s inference that “the earth hath he given to the children of men” proves a title “from fatherhood” is a non sequitur; “children of men” names mankind, not paternal authority. Even worse, using it to prove Adam’s monarchy is absurd unless “children of men” somehow signifies Adam, who had no father.

- Locke turns to the parallel grant after the Flood (Gen 9:1–3). Against Filmer’s claim that the blessing belongs to Noah alone “with subordination” or “in succession,” Locke stresses the plain wording: God “blessed Noah and his sons” and delivered creatures “into your hands” in the present. “Be fruitful and multiply” chiefly concerns the sons (Noah had no postdiluvian offspring), making subordination implausible.

- Filmer’s notions that Noah was “sole heir of the world” or would be “disinherited” by a common grant lack any scriptural warrant.

- Filmer’s attempt to recast Gen 9 as merely an “enlargement of commons” fails: “fear and dread” signals dominion; “into your hands they are delivered” confers property in possession; “every moving thing… shall be meat for you” extends property rights beyond Adam’s original, more limited allowance. Parallelism thus undercuts any claim that Adam held private, monarchic dominion.
