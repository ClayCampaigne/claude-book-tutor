<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter dismantles Filmer’s attempt—drawing on Selden—to ground political sovereignty in Genesis 1:28. Filmer claims that God’s grant made Adam “general lord,” whence, by fatherhood, a monarch of the whole world. Locke first exposes Filmer’s equivocation: he slides between dominion as property over creatures and sovereignty over persons.

Locke’s rebuttal is twofold. First, Scripture grants no dominion over men. The phrase “every living thing that moveth” uses the Hebrew chayah and remes—terms that, in the creation narrative and the Septuagint, denote irrational animals (wild beasts and creeping things), not human beings. The parallel grant after the Flood confirms this: God tells Noah and his sons that “every moving thing” is delivered into their hand and “shall be meat” for them. If “moving thing” included humans, it would absurdly authorize eating one’s subjects. Psalm 8 likewise interprets the charter as mankind’s rule over animals, not men over men. Second, the grant is not exclusive to Adam. It is plural (“God blessed them… have dominion”), already envisaged in “let them have dominion,” and flows from the image of God—intellectual nature—shared by all humans. “Them” thus names the species and its individuals, not Adam alone.

Filmer’s appeal to “the earth hath he given to the children of men” to prove title from fatherhood is a non sequitur; “children of men” means mankind, and cannot single out Adam, who had no father. Turning to Genesis 9, Locke rejects Filmer’s claim that Noah held the blessing alone with subordination or succession. The text blesses “Noah and his sons,” directs “be fruitful and multiply” chiefly to the sons, and presently delivers creatures “into your hands.” The passage marks an enlargement of common property: fear and dread signal dominion; delivery “into your hands” confers possession; “every moving thing… shall be meat” grants a use-right Adam lacked. Property, before God, is but liberty to use; neither Adam nor Noah received private dominion excluding posterity.

Finally, even sole property would not yield sovereignty. The notion that a proprietor may starve others into political subjection contradicts God’s ends and natural right to relief; any submission under necessity rests on consent, not on property. Thus sovereignty-from-private-dominion collapses—and in fact Adam was given no such private dominion to begin with.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Targeted claim: Filmer (citing Selden) argues Gen 1:28 made Adam “general lord” and, by Filmer’s extension, “monarch of the whole world,” with political title deriving from fatherhood. Locke notes Filmer equivocates between property over creatures and sovereignty over people.

- Locke’s twofold rebuttal:
  1) No dominion over men is granted. The phrase “every living thing that moveth” uses Hebrew terms (chayah; remes) that, in the creation account (Gen 1:24–25) and the Septuagint, denote irrational animals (wild beasts and reptiles), not humans. The same terms reappear when God renews the grant to Noah and his sons (Gen 9:2–3), clearly addressing all mankind, not one man’s rule over others; v.3 even grants “every moving thing” for food, which would absurdly license eating subjects if “moving thing” included humans. Psalm 8 likewise interprets the grant as mankind’s dominion over animals, not men over men.
  2) The grant is not exclusive to Adam. It is plural—“God blessed them… said unto them, have dominion”—thus including Eve and, more fundamentally, the species envisaged in Gen 1:26 (“let them have dominion”). Dominion flows from the image of God (intellectual nature) shared by all humans.

- Conclusion: Gen 1:28 establishes common human dominion over animals, not Adam’s political monarchy or private proprietorship.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- “Them” in Gen 1:26–28 denotes the human species and its individuals, not Adam alone. Dominion flows from the image of God—intellectual nature—shared by all humans; Psalm 8 confirms this as mankind’s, not Adam’s, prerogative.

- Filmer’s inference that “the earth hath he given to the children of men” proves a title “from fatherhood” is a non sequitur; “children of men” names mankind, not paternal authority. Even worse, using it to prove Adam’s monarchy is absurd unless “children of men” somehow signifies Adam, who had no father.

- Locke turns to the parallel grant after the Flood (Gen 9:1–3). Against Filmer’s claim that the blessing belongs to Noah alone “with subordination” or “in succession,” Locke stresses the plain wording: God “blessed Noah and his sons” and delivered creatures “into your hands” in the present. “Be fruitful and multiply” chiefly concerns the sons (Noah had no postdiluvian offspring), making subordination implausible.

- Filmer’s notions that Noah was “sole heir of the world” or would be “disinherited” by a common grant lack any scriptural warrant.

- Filmer’s attempt to recast Gen 9 as merely an “enlargement of commons” fails: “fear and dread” signals dominion; “into your hands they are delivered” confers property in possession; “every moving thing… shall be meat for you” extends property rights beyond Adam’s original, more limited allowance. Parallelism thus undercuts any claim that Adam held private, monarchic dominion.

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Genesis 9 confers explicit, collective property and dominion to Noah and his sons beyond what Adam had: “into your hands they are delivered” signals property in possession; “every moving thing… shall be meat for you” grants the ultimate use-right (destruction by consumption), which Adam lacked (he had herbs in common with beasts). Property, in respect to God, is nothing but the liberty to use; thus postdiluvian permission enlarges property, showing neither Adam nor Noah held private dominion excluding posterity.

- Gen 1:28 establishes mankind’s species-wide superiority over animals, not Adam’s monarchy over men nor his sole proprietorship. The apostolic claim that God “gives us all things richly to enjoy” confirms common enjoyment, not alienation of all things to Adam and his heirs. Hence Filmer’s sovereignty-from-private-dominion collapses.

- Even if Adam had sole property in the earth, property does not yield sovereignty over persons. The idea that a proprietor could starve others into obedience contradicts God’s ends (increase and multiply) and moral order: the needy have a right to the surplus of the rich; withholding relief cannot confer a right over life. Any subjection born of necessity would rest on consent under compact, not on property itself—otherwise any advantage (stores in famine, money, a boat, ability to swim) could ground sovereignty, which is absurd.

- Therefore, private dominion cannot found sovereignty; and in fact Adam was given no such private dominion.
