- Motivation and end: Though naturally free and equal, people find their enjoyment of life, liberty, and estate insecure in the state of nature due to others’ bias and force. They therefore unite into commonwealths to preserve “property” (lives, liberties, estates)—the great and chief end of government.

- Defects of the state of nature:
  1) No established, settled, known, commonly accepted law to serve as a standard in disputes (natural law exists but is ill-applied through bias and ignorance).
  2) No known, impartial judge with authority to decide controversies.
  3) No power to back right judgments and execute sentences; offenders resist, making enforcement dangerous.

- Social compact and powers transferred: In nature each person has (a) a liberty to act for self- and others’ preservation within natural law, and (b) an executive power to punish violations. Upon entering a particular political society, individuals:
  - Submit the first to regulation by standing laws for the society’s preservation (thereby limiting natural liberty).
  - Entirely cede the executive power, pledging their force to the community’s executive.

- Limits on government: Since entry aims at better preserving self, liberty, and property, legislative/supreme power is confined to the common good: governing by promulgated, standing laws; impartial judges; using force only to execute laws at home and for defense abroad—all for the people’s peace, safety, and public good.
