<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
By nature people are free and equal, yet their enjoyment of life, liberty, and estate is insecure in the state of nature. Though natural law obliges all, its application there is marred by ignorance, bias, and force. To remedy this insecurity, individuals consent to unite in political society, the great and chief end of which is the preservation of “property” in Locke’s broad sense: their lives, liberties, and estates.

Locke traces this move from nature to commonwealth to three defects in the natural condition. First, there is no established, settled, known, and commonly accepted law to serve as a standard in disputes; natural law exists but is poorly applied. Second, there is no known, impartial judge with authority to decide controversies. Third, there is no public power to back right judgments and execute sentences, so offenders resist and enforcement becomes perilous.

Each person in nature holds two powers: a liberty to act for the preservation of self and others within the bounds of natural law, and an executive power to punish violations of that law. By entering a particular political society, people agree to have the first power regulated by standing laws directed to the community’s preservation, thereby limiting their natural liberty. They also entirely cede the second power, pledging their force to the community’s executive so that punishment and defense become public, not private, functions.

Accordingly, the legislative—or supreme—power is strictly limited by the ends for which it is entrusted. It must govern by promulgated, standing laws, not by arbitrary decrees; administer justice through known and impartial judges; and employ force only to execute the laws at home and to defend the commonwealth abroad. All political power is thus a fiduciary trust for the people’s peace, safety, and public good. Government that strays beyond these ends betrays its purpose, which is not to subject individuals to another’s will, but to secure their property more surely than the state of nature can.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Motivation and end: Though naturally free and equal, people find their enjoyment of life, liberty, and estate insecure in the state of nature due to others’ bias and force. They therefore unite into commonwealths to preserve “property” (lives, liberties, estates)—the great and chief end of government.

- Defects of the state of nature:
  1) No established, settled, known, commonly accepted law to serve as a standard in disputes (natural law exists but is ill-applied through bias and ignorance).
  2) No known, impartial judge with authority to decide controversies.
  3) No power to back right judgments and execute sentences; offenders resist, making enforcement dangerous.

- Social compact and powers transferred: In nature each person has (a) a liberty to act for self- and others’ preservation within natural law, and (b) an executive power to punish violations. Upon entering a particular political society, individuals:
  - Submit the first to regulation by standing laws for the society’s preservation (thereby limiting natural liberty).
  - Entirely cede the executive power, pledging their force to the community’s executive.

- Limits on government: Since entry aims at better preserving self, liberty, and property, legislative/supreme power is confined to the common good: governing by promulgated, standing laws; impartial judges; using force only to execute laws at home and for defense abroad—all for the people’s peace, safety, and public good.
