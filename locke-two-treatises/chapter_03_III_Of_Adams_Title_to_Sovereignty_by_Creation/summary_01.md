Locke begins refuting Filmer’s claim that natural freedom cannot be affirmed without denying Adam’s creation. Mere creation confers existence, not sovereignty; otherwise the lion, likewise created, would have equal title. Filmer retreats to “God’s appointment,” but Locke shows this is equivocal and incoherent:

- If “appointment” means providence, Adam could not be de facto governor when there were no subjects.
- If it means a positive grant (Gen. 1:28), it was not “as soon as created,” since the grant follows Eve’s creation; moreover Filmer elsewhere makes Gen. 3:16 the “original grant,” which is after the Fall—contradicting immediacy.
- If it means law of nature, the claim becomes circular: Adam was governor by nature because he was governor by nature.

Locke also exposes Filmer’s equivocation on “monarch” (proprietor of the world vs sovereign ruler). Even granting paternal right by nature, such right arises from begetting; Adam had no title “as soon as created.” Filmer’s fallback—Adam was king “in habit, not in act”—is ridiculed as empty. At most Adam had a possibility, no actual right, no necessary link between creation and government. Locke closes by criticizing Filmer’s method of ambiguities and unproved assertions masquerading as argument.
