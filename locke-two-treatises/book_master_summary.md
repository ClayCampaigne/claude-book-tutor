# Book Overview
Locke demolishes Filmer’s patriarchal “divine right” by showing Adam had no transmissible sovereignty and that no present ruler can claim title through him. He then constructs a consent-based political theory: people leave the state of nature to secure their lives, liberties, and estates under known laws, limited legislatures, separated powers, and a fiduciary trust revocable upon tyranny, conquest without consent, usurpation, or dissolution of the legislative.

# Chapter Summaries
1. I: Locke targets Filmer’s absolute monarchy and Adamic heirship as a tyrannical novelty that flatters princes, strips natural freedom, destabilizes existing titles, and lacks scriptural or rational warrant; he vows to expose its failures and restore the principle that legitimate government rests on the consent of free and equal persons, not on patriarchal dominion.

2. Ii Of Paternal And Regal Power: Locke attacks Filmer’s keystone—equating paternal with regal power—showing Filmer’s undefined “fatherly authority” masks claims of absolute, lawless dominion justified by a mangled “Honour thy father”; he distills Filmer’s four proofs (creation, conjugal, paternal dominion, universal property) and announces a systematic refutation to recover consent as the only political foundation.

3. Iii Of Adams Title To Sovereignty By Creation: Creation confers existence, not sovereignty; “God’s appointment” wavers between providence, grant, and nature, proving nothing; Adam could not be monarch “as soon as created,” lacking subjects and issue, and a kingship “in habit” is no power at all; Locke exposes equivocations on “monarch” and denies any necessary link from creation to political government.

4. Iv Of Adams Title To Sovereignty By Donation Gen 1: Genesis 1:28 grants mankind dominion over animals, not sovereignty over men, and addresses “them,” not Adam alone; Genesis 9 similarly enlarges common use, not private dominion; even exclusive property could not yield political sovereignty, since necessity and relief limit proprietors and any submission under want rests on consent, not ownership.

5. V Of Adams Title To Sovereignty By The Subjection: Genesis 3:16 is a judgment on Eve, foretelling marital subordination and childbirth pains, not a political charter to Adam; read politically, it absurdly makes every husband a monarch; Filmer’s selective hermeneutics invert singular and plural texts; at most, the verse concerns conjugal order, leaving civil sovereignty ungrounded in Scripture.

6. Vi Of Adams Title To Sovereignty By Fatherhood: Begetting gives no right to destroy; God is life’s giver, and mothers share equal generative title; custom cannot sanctify child-selling or killing, which Scripture condemns; “Honour thy father and thy mother” proves shared, fiduciary parental authority, not absolutism; Filmer’s multiplying “fatherhoods” collapses into contradiction, confirming natural freedom and consent.

7. Vii Of Fatherhood And Property Considered Together: Even granting Adam sole property and paternal absolutism, inheritance splits titles: property may pass to the eldest, but paternal power cannot descend over siblings; Filmer’s fusion yields multiple supremes or nullifies fatherhood/property alternately; cases like Cain and Abel or Noah’s partition show property cannot found sovereignty without dissolving Filmer’s scriptural premises.

8. Viii Of The Conveyance Of Adams Sovereign Monarchy: Locke assembles Filmer’s inconsistent routes—succession, grant, usurpation, election—then shows his final criterion (“whoever holds supreme power is king”) collapses Adamic right into mere success; Locke proposes testing inheritance, grant, usurpation, and election in turn, arguing none can transmit Adam’s alleged authority or obligate present subjects.

9. Ix Of Monarchy By Inheritance From Adam: Rightful obedience requires a known title; Adam’s supposed personal grants would lapse; property originates in preservation and yields no sovereignty; private estates descend for children’s maintenance, not dominion; succession mirrors the original title—consent descends by consent, divine grants by designation, begetting by none—so even if Adam ruled, his authority died with him.

10. X Of The Heir To Adams Monarchical Power: If Adamic heirship alone legitimates rule, only one rightful king exists at any time and all others are usurpers; if not necessary, Filmer’s doctrine is irrelevant; in practice, no one can know the true heir, suspending obligation; allowing coheirs makes all heirs kings, dissolving government; the theory is incoherent or anarchic.

11. Xi Who Heir: Filmer cannot specify an heir or rules of descent; real succession puzzles force him into “present possession,” sanctifying usurpation; Scripture’s “heir” denotes goods, not sovereignty; patriarchal episodes show consent, not Adamic kingship; Babel and Israel’s polity display multiple founders, divine appointments, and non-primogenitary lines; without determinate heirs, hereditary monarchy cannot bind.

12. I Of Political Power: Clearing confusions among household, marital, parental, and servile relations, Locke defines political power as the right to make and enforce standing laws for preserving property (life, liberty, estate) and defending the community, held solely in trust for the public good—thereby separating civil authority from private dominions and supplying a criterion of legitimacy.

13. Ii Of The State Of Nature: The state of nature is a condition of freedom and equality under the law of reason, obliging preservation of self and others; each holds a public right to punish and an injured right to reparation; inconveniences (partiality, uncertainty, weakness) prompt civil society; absolute monarchy worsens them; compacts alone end the state of nature.

14. Iii Of The State Of War: War arises when someone uses force without right or claims absolute power, declaring hostility against another’s life; attempted enslavement is war; one may kill a violent thief who denies appeal to law; a common judge ends war only where effective; failing earthly remedy, an appeal to heaven remains until safety is restored.

15. Iv Of Slavery: Freedom means exemption from another’s arbitrary will and cannot be alienated; true slavery is a continued state of war justified only against criminals whose lives are forfeit; spared captives serve under the conqueror’s despotical power yet may resist and choose death; compacts transform relations into civil obligations; Judaic “self-sale” creates bounded servitude, not absolute slavery.

16. V Of Property: God gave the world in common; labor mixes with common resources to create private property without universal consent, bounded by spoilage and “enough-and-as-good”; labor adds the chief value and benefits mankind; money’s tacit consent relaxes spoilage and permits durable inequality; civil laws refine titles, but labor and use remain the root.

17. Vi Of Paternal Power: Parental (not paternal) power is joint, temporary, and fiduciary, justified by children’s want of reason; it directs for the child’s good, not over life, liberty, or estate, and ends at maturity though honor persists; adult submission stems only from estate conditions; early “family monarchies” arose from consent and convenience, not natural political dominion.

18. Vii Of Political Or Civil Society: Household ties (marriage, parent–child, master–servant) are not the commonwealth; political society forms when individuals give up natural executive power to a public authority judging by standing laws and enforcing judgments; absolute monarchy lacks an appeal against the prince and so is inconsistent with civil society’s very purpose.

19. Viii Of The Beginning Of Political Societies: Political society begins by consent to unite and be governed by the majority; history and examples (Rome, Venice, American peoples) show voluntary unions and elective leadership; consent can be express (permanent membership) or tacit (obedience during enjoyment of protection/land); birth under dominion does not bind adults absent their own consent.

20. Ix Of The Ends Of Political Society And Government: People quit the state of nature to remedy three defects—no settled law, no impartial judge, no power to enforce—ceding the executive power and regulating liberty by standing laws; legislatures are fiduciary, bound to govern by promulgated rules, impartial justice, and force for protection, all to secure property broadly construed.

21. X Of The Forms Of A Commonwealth: The people, originally holding supreme power, may lodge the legislative in themselves (democracy), a few (oligarchy), or one (monarchy), hereditary or elective, or compound forms; the form follows the legislative’s seat; grants for life or term naturally expire and revert, enabling lawful alteration of the governmental frame by the community.

22. Xi Of The Extent Of The Legislative Power: The legislative is supreme yet bounded by the law of nature and public trust: it must govern by standing, general laws with known judges; cannot destroy or enslave; cannot tax or take property without consent (self or representatives); and cannot transfer the lawmaking power it received from the people.

23. Xii Of The Legislative, Executive, And Federative Power: Legislative directs ends and should not be always in being; execution is continuous and applies settled laws; federative manages foreign affairs; prudence and unified command unite executive and federative, while separation from legislative prevents self-dealing; legislative supremacy coexists with accountability under laws binding legislators themselves.

24. Xiii Of The Subordination Of The Powers Of The Commonwealth: Legislative remains supreme as a trust for preservation; executives are chief ministers of the law, removable or subordinate; prerogatives like convening assemblies are for safety; obstructing or corrupting the legislature is warfare against the people; executives must enable fair representation and may prudently rebalance decayed constituencies to restore rightful frames.

25. Xiv Of Prerogative: Prerogative is executive discretion to act for the public good where law is silent, slow, or, rarely, contrary; good rulers enjoy latitude while serving common safety; abuse prompts legal specification; no one has a right to harm the people; when no earthly judge stands between executive and legislature, the people retain the last judgment—an appeal to heaven.

26. Xv Of Paternal, Political, And Despotical Power Considered Together: Parental power is fiduciary, temporary, and limited; political power arises by compact and is bounded by the public good and property’s preservation; despotical power is absolute over forfeited lives, arising only from just war; through the lens of property, civil freedom is incompatible with slavery, and absolute dominion cannot exist within civil society.

27. Xvi Of Conquest: Force can destroy governments but cannot create right; unjust conquest binds none, and the conquered retain appeal to heaven; even in just war, conquerors gain despotical power only over aggressors’ lives and proportionate damages, not over innocents, posterity, or lands; grants post‑conquest create true property; any wider rule is mere force and revocable.

28. Xvii Of Usurpation: Usurpation is a domestic seizure of another’s office, preserving forms but lacking title; it never confers right, nor does time cleanse it; tyranny adds power beyond law to usurpation; only free, express ratification by the people can cure the defect; legitimate constitutions must define lawful appointment to avoid anarchy in succession.

29. Xviii Of Tyranny: Tyranny is power beyond right—will for law—pursuing private ends; it can occur under any form; where law ends, tyranny begins, and illegal force may be resisted, especially by stopping subordinate agents; resistance aims at restoring law, not anarchy; a long train of designs against liberty warrants collective defense; blame lies with law‑perverters, not preservers.

30. Xix Of The Dissolution Of Government: Government dissolves when the legislative is altered or disabled—by substituting will for law, blocking free assemblies, corrupting elections, or subjecting the people to foreign power—or when execution ceases; such breaches of trust place rulers in a state of war with the people; upon dissolution, supreme power reverts to society to reconstitute a rightful legislature.
