- Civil society exists only where individuals quit their natural executive power and vest it in a public authority that: (a) judges offences by standing laws, (b) decides how to vindicate external injuries case by case, and (c) can employ the combined force of members to execute its judgments.

- Absolute monarchy is incompatible with civil society because it lacks an earthly appeal against the ruler. With the prince holding both legislative and executive power, subjects have no impartial judge to redress injuries from him; thus they remain in a state of nature vis-à-vis the prince—and worse off than ordinary nature, since they are denied even the liberty to judge or defend their rights.

- Courts in absolute monarchies regulate disputes among subjects, but provide no fence against the ruler’s oppression; defenders treat inquiry into safety from the ruler as seditious, effectively placing all under law except the ruler, who retains unchecked, state-of-nature liberty amplified by impunity.

- When people find no appeal against a man outside civil bounds, they reckon themselves in nature toward him and seek true civil security. Historically, initial deference to a virtuous arbitrator gave way—once property proved insecure under successors—to lodging the legislature in collective bodies (senates/parliaments), making every person equally subject to laws he helps make, with no exemptions.

- Maxim: No one in civil society can be above its laws; if any can act without appeal, he is not a member, collapsing the distinction between society and the state of nature.
