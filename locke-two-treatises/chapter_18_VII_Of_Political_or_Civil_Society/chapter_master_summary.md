<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke distinguishes the household from political society by their aims, bonds, and limits. The first human associations—marriage, then parent–child, then master–servant—often coexist within a family, but none is a commonwealth. Conjugal society is a voluntary compact chiefly ordered to procreation and the continued upbringing of children. Because human young remain dependent while the mother can conceive again, a durable pair-bond promotes foresight, industry, and provision for offspring, creating a community of interests oriented to their support and inheritance. Absent positive law requiring perpetuity, the marital compact may be limited by consent, time, or conditions, so long as procreation and education are secured. In common affairs the “last determination” naturally falls to the husband as the stronger, but only over shared interests; it conveys no power over the wife’s life, liberty, or peculiar rights. Wives may separate where natural right or contract permits, and magistrates adjudicate disputes without redefining marriage’s ends.

Master–servant is likewise a time-bound, contractual relation conferring only stipulated powers. Slaves—lawful captives who have forfeited life and liberty—hold no property and so are no parts of civil society, whose chief end is the preservation of property (life, liberty, estate). A family, even if it resembles a small monarchy, lacks absolute power and legislative authority over life and death; household rule is not political rule.

Political or civil society arises only when individuals quit their natural executive power to judge and punish breaches of the law of nature and vest it in a public authority that judges by standing laws, decides how to vindicate external injuries, and can employ the combined force of members to execute its judgments. By this consent the community gains legislative and executive/war powers for the public good, and people either unite under one supreme government or incorporate into an existing one.

Absolute monarchy is incompatible with civil society: with prince and executive united, there is no earthly appeal against the ruler, leaving subjects in a worse state than nature. Courts among subjects do not fence against the prince. Hence the maxim: no one within civil society may stand above its laws; where any can act without appeal, civil society collapses into the state of nature.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke distinguishes domestic relations from political society by their ends, bonds, and limits. The first societies—marriage, then parent–child, then master–servant—often cohabit in a family but are not political society.

- Conjugal society:
  - A voluntary compact chiefly ordered to procreation and the continued upbringing of children; it entails mutual support and a community of interests for the offspring’s sake.
  - Human pair-bonds last longer than in many animals because human young remain dependent while the mother can conceive again; durable marriage serves foresight, industry, and provision for children.
  - Absent positive law requiring perpetuity, the marital compact could be determinable by consent/time/conditions so long as procreation, education, and inheritance are secured.
  - A “last determination” in common affairs naturally falls to the husband as stronger, but only over shared interests; it grants no power over the wife’s life or peculiar rights. Wives may separate where natural right or contract allows; magistrates adjudicate disputes, not reshape conjugal ends.

- Master–servant is a time-limited, contractual relation with only the powers stipulated. Slaves (lawful captives) have forfeited life/liberty and hold no property; thus they are not parts of civil society, whose chief end is preservation of property.

- A family, even if resembling a small monarchy, lacks absolute power and legislative authority over life and death (except over a slave); therefore household rule ≠ political rule.

- Definition and origin of political/civil society:
  - By nature, each person holds an executive power to judge and punish breaches of the law of nature.
  - Political society exists only where each member quits this natural executive power and resigns it to the community, establishing common, standing laws and authorized judges. Those without such a common appeal remain in the state of nature.
  - The commonwealth thereby acquires legislative power (to set punishments for internal transgressions) and executive/war power (to vindicate injuries from without), all for preserving members’ property—life, liberty, estate.
  - Members also grant the community a right to employ their force to execute its judgments; these are their own by consent/representation.
  - Political society is formed when people unite under one supreme government or when individuals incorporate into an existing one, authorizing its legislative for the public good and exiting the state of nature among themselves.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Civil society exists only where individuals quit their natural executive power and vest it in a public authority that: (a) judges offences by standing laws, (b) decides how to vindicate external injuries case by case, and (c) can employ the combined force of members to execute its judgments.

- Absolute monarchy is incompatible with civil society because it lacks an earthly appeal against the ruler. With the prince holding both legislative and executive power, subjects have no impartial judge to redress injuries from him; thus they remain in a state of nature vis-à-vis the prince—and worse off than ordinary nature, since they are denied even the liberty to judge or defend their rights.

- Courts in absolute monarchies regulate disputes among subjects, but provide no fence against the ruler’s oppression; defenders treat inquiry into safety from the ruler as seditious, effectively placing all under law except the ruler, who retains unchecked, state-of-nature liberty amplified by impunity.

- When people find no appeal against a man outside civil bounds, they reckon themselves in nature toward him and seek true civil security. Historically, initial deference to a virtuous arbitrator gave way—once property proved insecure under successors—to lodging the legislature in collective bodies (senates/parliaments), making every person equally subject to laws he helps make, with no exemptions.

- Maxim: No one in civil society can be above its laws; if any can act without appeal, he is not a member, collapsing the distinction between society and the state of nature.
