- Locke distinguishes domestic relations from political society by their ends, bonds, and limits. The first societies—marriage, then parent–child, then master–servant—often cohabit in a family but are not political society.

- Conjugal society:
  - A voluntary compact chiefly ordered to procreation and the continued upbringing of children; it entails mutual support and a community of interests for the offspring’s sake.
  - Human pair-bonds last longer than in many animals because human young remain dependent while the mother can conceive again; durable marriage serves foresight, industry, and provision for children.
  - Absent positive law requiring perpetuity, the marital compact could be determinable by consent/time/conditions so long as procreation, education, and inheritance are secured.
  - A “last determination” in common affairs naturally falls to the husband as stronger, but only over shared interests; it grants no power over the wife’s life or peculiar rights. Wives may separate where natural right or contract allows; magistrates adjudicate disputes, not reshape conjugal ends.

- Master–servant is a time-limited, contractual relation with only the powers stipulated. Slaves (lawful captives) have forfeited life/liberty and hold no property; thus they are not parts of civil society, whose chief end is preservation of property.

- A family, even if resembling a small monarchy, lacks absolute power and legislative authority over life and death (except over a slave); therefore household rule ≠ political rule.

- Definition and origin of political/civil society:
  - By nature, each person holds an executive power to judge and punish breaches of the law of nature.
  - Political society exists only where each member quits this natural executive power and resigns it to the community, establishing common, standing laws and authorized judges. Those without such a common appeal remain in the state of nature.
  - The commonwealth thereby acquires legislative power (to set punishments for internal transgressions) and executive/war power (to vindicate injuries from without), all for preserving members’ property—life, liberty, estate.
  - Members also grant the community a right to employ their force to execute its judgments; these are their own by consent/representation.
  - Political society is formed when people unite under one supreme government or when individuals incorporate into an existing one, authorizing its legislative for the public good and exiting the state of nature among themselves.
