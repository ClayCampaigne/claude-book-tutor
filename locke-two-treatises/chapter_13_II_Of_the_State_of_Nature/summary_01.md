- Locke begins deriving political power from its origin by defining the state of nature: a condition of perfect freedom and equality to order one’s actions and dispose of one’s person and possessions within the bounds of the law of nature, without leave of any other. Equality holds unless God clearly designates a superior.
- With Hooker, Locke grounds duties of mutual love, justice, and charity in this natural equality.
- The state of nature is liberty, not license. Reason is the law of nature: because all are God’s workmanship and servants, no one may harm another’s life, health, liberty, or possessions. Each must preserve himself and, where consistent, preserve others.
- For that law not to be vain, execution is in every person’s hands: everyone may punish violators to the extent needed for restraint and reparation, not arbitrarily. Murderers may be killed as having declared war on mankind; this also explains how magistrates can punish aliens (by natural, not civil, right).
- Distinguishes two rights: public punishment (in all) and private reparation (in the injured only); magistrates may remit the former for public good but cannot remit the latter.
- Replies to the “judge in one’s own case” objection: civil government remedies these inconveniences, but absolute monarchy is worse (one man judging his own case without appeal). The state of nature is preferable to such absolutism.
- On existence: rulers of independent communities are in a state of nature relative to one another; only a mutual agreement to unite into one body politic ends it. Other compacts (alliances, leagues) do not.
