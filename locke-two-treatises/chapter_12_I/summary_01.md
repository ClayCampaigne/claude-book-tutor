- Locke transitions from refuting Filmer to founding a positive account of political authority. He recaps: Adam had no sovereign authority; even if he had, heirs had no transmissible right; even if transmissible, no natural or divine law determines rightful succession in all cases; and even if that were settled, Adam’s eldest line is irretrievably lost. Therefore no present ruler can derive any authority from “Adam’s private dominion and paternal jurisdiction.”

- To avoid reducing government to mere force—inviting perpetual disorder—Locke seeks a different origin and criterion for political power and a method to identify rightful rulers.

- He proposes to distinguish political power from other relations that can coexist in one person: paternal over children, masterly over servants, marital over wife, lordly over slaves—so we don’t conflate a ruler of a commonwealth with a family head or ship captain.

- Definition: Political power is the right to make laws—with death and lesser penalties—for regulating and preserving property, to employ the community’s force to execute those laws and defend against foreign injury, and to do all this solely for the public good.
