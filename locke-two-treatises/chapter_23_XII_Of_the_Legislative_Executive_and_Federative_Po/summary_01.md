- Locke distinguishes three powers in a commonwealth:
  - Legislative: has the right to direct how the commonwealth’s force is used for preserving the community. It need not sit continuously; to prevent self-dealing, its members should not also hold execution, and once adjourned they are subject to the laws they made—tying them to the public good.
  - Executive: must be continuously in being to enforce standing laws that persist after brief legislative sessions.
  - Federative: the power over foreign affairs—war, peace, leagues, alliances, and all dealings with those outside the commonwealth—arising because the community, vis-à-vis outsiders, remains as one body in the state of nature.

- Executive and federative are conceptually distinct (municipal enforcement vs external management) but are “almost always” united institutionally because:
  - Foreign affairs cannot be governed well by antecedent, standing, positive laws; they require prudence responsive to others’ changing designs and interests.
  - Both powers require command of the commonwealth’s force; splitting that force between independent, non-subordinate hands would create conflicting commands, disorder, and potential ruin.

- Thus, well-ordered polities separate legislative from execution, while typically uniting executive and federative under one authority.
