<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Locke divides political power within a commonwealth into three functions—legislative, executive, and federative—and argues that sound constitutional design assigns and relates them in specific ways.

The legislative power is primary in that it directs how the commonwealth’s force is to be used for the preservation of the community. It does not need to sit permanently; indeed, because frequent, detailed administration fosters self-dealing, it should not. To guard against using lawmaking to entrench private advantage, those who make the laws should not also execute them. Once the legislative has adjourned, its members are themselves subject to the laws they enacted, which binds them to the public good and keeps legislative supremacy compatible with accountability under the rule of law.

Because laws continue in force between legislative sessions, the executive power must be constantly in being to enforce those standing rules. Its charge is municipal: applying established law to particular cases, ensuring compliance, and maintaining order day to day.

Distinct from executive is the federative power, which governs the commonwealth’s relations with outsiders—war and peace, treaties, alliances, and all commerce with foreign states and peoples. Locke roots this in the fact that, vis-à-vis other communities, the political society remains as a single person in a state of nature, lacking a shared superior and thus needing a faculty to manage external threats and opportunities.

Though conceptually different, executive and federative are almost always united in practice. Foreign affairs cannot be well managed by antecedent, standing, positive laws; they require prudence responsive to others’ changing designs and interests. Moreover, both powers require command over the commonwealth’s force. Dividing that force between independent hands risks contradictory orders, paralysis, and ruin. Hence, well-ordered polities separate lawmaking from execution while typically joining executive and federative authority, preserving legislative direction of ends alongside a unified, agile administration of both domestic enforcement and external policy.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Locke distinguishes three powers in a commonwealth:
  - Legislative: has the right to direct how the commonwealth’s force is used for preserving the community. It need not sit continuously; to prevent self-dealing, its members should not also hold execution, and once adjourned they are subject to the laws they made—tying them to the public good.
  - Executive: must be continuously in being to enforce standing laws that persist after brief legislative sessions.
  - Federative: the power over foreign affairs—war, peace, leagues, alliances, and all dealings with those outside the commonwealth—arising because the community, vis-à-vis outsiders, remains as one body in the state of nature.

- Executive and federative are conceptually distinct (municipal enforcement vs external management) but are “almost always” united institutionally because:
  - Foreign affairs cannot be governed well by antecedent, standing, positive laws; they require prudence responsive to others’ changing designs and interests.
  - Both powers require command of the commonwealth’s force; splitting that force between independent, non-subordinate hands would create conflicting commands, disorder, and potential ruin.

- Thus, well-ordered polities separate legislative from execution, while typically uniting executive and federative under one authority.
