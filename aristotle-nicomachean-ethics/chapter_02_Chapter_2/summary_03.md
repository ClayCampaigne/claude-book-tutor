- Social virtues completed:
  - Pleasantness in general life: friendliness is the mean; excess without ulterior motive is obsequiousness, with self-serving motive is flattery; defect is quarrelsomeness/peevishness.
  - Shame: not a virtue, but the modest (who feel shame to the right degree) are praised; excess is shamefacedness; defect is shamelessness.
  - Righteous indignation is the mean between envy (pained at anyone’s prosperity) and malevolence (rejoicing in others’ misfortune), being pained only at undeserved prosperity.
  - Justice has multiple senses and will be treated later as kinds of moderation; intellectual virtues will follow.

- Opposition structure:
  - Each mean is opposed to both extremes; extremes are more contrary to each other than to the mean. Some extremes resemble the mean (e.g., foolhardiness to courage), which obscures contrasts.
  - Which extreme is “more opposed” varies:
    - By the thing itself: the extreme farther from the mean (e.g., cowardice vs courage) is more opposed.
    - By our tendencies: what we’re more prone to (especially excess in pleasures) is treated as more opposed (thus profligacy vs temperance).

- Practical guidance for hitting the mean:
  - It’s hard; right action requires the right person, amount, time, aim, and manner.
  - Steer away first from the more opposed extreme; “bend the stick” toward the opposite of your bias.
  - Be especially wary of pleasure’s partiality.
  - Slight deviations aren’t blamed; precise limits can’t be fixed by reasoning—particulars are judged by perception.
