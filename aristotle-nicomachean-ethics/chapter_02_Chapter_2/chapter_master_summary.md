<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Having established in Book I that happiness is activity in accord with virtue, Aristotle now explains how moral virtue arises and what it is. He distinguishes intellectual virtue, which grows through teaching and time, from moral virtue (êthikê), which is produced by habit (ethos). Nature gives us capacities to be affected; repeated actions actualize them: by doing just, temperate, and courageous deeds we become just, temperate, and courageous. Hence legislators aim to habituate citizens, and constitutions are judged by how well they form character. The same kinds of actions produce, manifest, preserve, and also destroy dispositions: done well they build virtue; done badly they breed vice—making early training decisive.

Because ethics concerns particulars, the account is schematic: right action must accord with right reason (later identified with the prudent person’s), and requires situational discernment. Pleasure and pain are the chief test and target of formation: the virtuous feel them in the right things, at the right times and in the right way. Education tunes these responses, correction relies on them, and pleasure especially misleads; resisting it is hardest and most praiseworthy. Moreover, doing a just or temperate deed is not yet being just or temperate: one must know what one is doing, choose it for its own sake, and act from a firm, stable character—acquired by repetition.

Virtue is not an emotion or mere capacity but a stable habit (hexis) that makes its possessor good and enables good functioning. It is a mean in passions and actions between excess and deficiency, “relative to us,” determined by right reason; yet relative to what is best it is in a sense an extreme of excellence. There is no mean for intrinsically base acts or passions (e.g., murder, theft, envy).

Aristotle illustrates the mean with courage, temperance, liberality (and magnificence), greatness of soul (with lesser honors lacking a settled name for the mean), gentleness, truthfulness, wittiness, and friendliness; shame is praised though not a virtue, and righteous indignation lies between envy and malevolence. Each mean is opposed to both extremes, which are more contrary to each other and sometimes mimic the mean. Since hitting the mean is hard, one should steer away from the more dangerous extreme, “bend the stick” against one’s bias, be especially wary of pleasure’s partiality, and accept that precise rules are impossible; particulars are judged by perception. Justice and the intellectual virtues follow.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Transition from Book I: Since happiness is activity in accord with virtue, Aristotle now explains how moral virtue arises and what it is.
- Two kinds of excellence: intellectual virtue grows by teaching and time; moral virtue (êthikê) arises from habit (ethos). We are not born virtuous or vicious; nature gives the capacity, habit actualizes it.
- We acquire virtues by doing the corresponding acts (as with arts): just acts make us just; temperate/courageous acts make us temperate/courageous. Legislators aim to habituate citizens; constitutions are judged by success in this.
- The same kinds of actions produce, manifest, preserve, and destroy virtues and vices: doing them well forms virtue; doing them badly forms vice. Early training matters decisively.
- Practical method: actions must accord with right reason (to be specified later). Ethical reasoning is in outline; particulars require judgment, like medicine/navigation.
- Virtue is a mean relative to us between excess and deficiency (e.g., courage between cowardice and rashness; temperance between insensibility and profligacy). Moderation preserves, extremes ruin.
- Pleasure and pain are the test and target of moral formation: the virtuous take right pleasures and pains in the right things, times, and ways. Education must tune our pleasures/pains; correction uses them. Error is especially about pleasure.
- Virtue and politics centrally concern managing pleasures/pains; resisting pleasure is hardest and most praiseworthy.
- Doing just/temperate acts is not yet being just/temperate: the agent must know, choose the act for its own sake, and act from a firm character—conditions built by repetition.
- Classification: states of soul are passions, faculties, or habits (hexeis). Virtue is a stable habit/disposition, not a passion or mere capacity, and involves deliberate choice and proper regulation of affections.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Virtue is not an emotion or a mere faculty: we are praised/blamed and called good/bad for virtues/vices, not for feeling emotions or simply having capacities; emotions can occur without choice, whereas virtue requires choice; emotions are “movements,” virtues are stable dispositions; faculties are given by nature, but virtue is not.
- Therefore, virtue is a trained, stable habit that makes its subject good and enables good functioning.
- Doctrine of the mean: in passions and actions there are excesses and deficiencies; virtue hits the mean “relative to us,” not an arithmetic mean, and is determined by right reason—as the prudent person would determine. Arts aim at such means; virtue, being more exact, does so too. It is a mean between two vices (excess/defect), yet in relation to what is best it is an “extreme” of perfection. Evil has many ways; hitting the mean is hard.
- No mean for acts/passions bad in themselves (e.g., malevolence, shamelessness, envy; adultery, theft, murder).
- Catalogue of means and extremes:
  - Fear/confidence: courage; rashness (excess in confidence), cowardice (excess in fear); nameless excess in fearlessness.
  - Bodily pleasures/pains: temperance; profligacy (excess); insensibility (defect, rare).
  - Money: liberality; prodigality (spends too much, takes too little); illiberality (takes too much, spends too little). For large expenditures: magnificence; vulgarity (excess), meanness (defect).
  - Honor: high-mindedness for great honors; vanity/excess, smallness of soul/defect. For lesser honors: mean lacks a name; extremes are ambitious vs unambitious; common usage is equivocal.
  - Anger: gentleness; wrathfulness (excess), wrathlessness (defect).
  - Social intercourse:
    - Truthfulness: truthfulness; boasting (excess), irony/self-deprecation (defect).
    - Amusement: wittiness; buffoonery (excess), boorishness (defect).
    - General pleasantness: friendliness; obsequiousness/flattery (excess), quarrelsomeness/peevishness (defect).
  - Additional affective means: modesty (praised though not a virtue) between shamefacedness and shamelessness; righteous indignation between envy and malevolence.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Social virtues completed:
  - Pleasantness in general life: friendliness is the mean; excess without ulterior motive is obsequiousness, with self-serving motive is flattery; defect is quarrelsomeness/peevishness.
  - Shame: not a virtue, but the modest (who feel shame to the right degree) are praised; excess is shamefacedness; defect is shamelessness.
  - Righteous indignation is the mean between envy (pained at anyone’s prosperity) and malevolence (rejoicing in others’ misfortune), being pained only at undeserved prosperity.
  - Justice has multiple senses and will be treated later as kinds of moderation; intellectual virtues will follow.

- Opposition structure:
  - Each mean is opposed to both extremes; extremes are more contrary to each other than to the mean. Some extremes resemble the mean (e.g., foolhardiness to courage), which obscures contrasts.
  - Which extreme is “more opposed” varies:
    - By the thing itself: the extreme farther from the mean (e.g., cowardice vs courage) is more opposed.
    - By our tendencies: what we’re more prone to (especially excess in pleasures) is treated as more opposed (thus profligacy vs temperance).

- Practical guidance for hitting the mean:
  - It’s hard; right action requires the right person, amount, time, aim, and manner.
  - Steer away first from the more opposed extreme; “bend the stick” toward the opposite of your bias.
  - Be especially wary of pleasure’s partiality.
  - Slight deviations aren’t blamed; precise limits can’t be fixed by reasoning—particulars are judged by perception.
