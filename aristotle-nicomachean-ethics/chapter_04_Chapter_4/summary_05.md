- Closure on social virtues: There are three “means” in social interaction, all concerning conversation/joint action. One regulates truthfulness about oneself; the other two regulate pleasure—one in amusements (wit), the other in general intercourse (friendliness). Recreation is necessary, but the boor contributes nothing and takes offense at everything.

- Shame (aidōs) is not a virtue but a feeling: a fear of disgrace, evidenced by bodily signs (blushing), akin to fear of danger. As a feeling, it lacks the stable, trained character (hexis) required for virtue.

- Fitting scope: Shame suits youth, whose emotions mislead them; it restrains them from wrong. It is unfitting to praise adults for being prone to shame, since the good person should not do what merits shame.

- Normative point: Shame presupposes base voluntary acts; the good person will not voluntarily do such acts. At best, shame is “hypothetically” good (if one did wrong, one would be ashamed), but virtues are not hypothetical.

- Being shameless is bad, but doing shameful acts and then being ashamed is not good. By analogy, continence is likewise not a virtue but intermediate (to be treated later).

- Transition: Having closed these character traits, Aristotle turns to justice.
