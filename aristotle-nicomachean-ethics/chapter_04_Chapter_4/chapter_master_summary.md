<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Aristotle surveys virtues that regulate the use of external goods and social life by locating means between excess and deficiency, guided by the noble and proportionate to person and occasion. Liberality concerns the use of wealth—chiefly giving rather than acquiring. The liberal give gladly, to the right people, in the right way and time; they shun base sources of income, manage property to enable fine giving, and are proportionate to their means—small gifts may be more liberal than large ones. They are easy to deal with and even easy to cheat, preferring noble expenditure to money. Prodigality exceeds in giving and fails in right taking; “pure” prodigals are corrigible, but most fund spending from bad sources and lavish on flatterers, tending toward profligacy. Illiberality, the true contrary, withholds giving and grabs small gains, often by base means; it is common, worse, and hard to cure. Princes escape the label “prodigal” because their scale obscures excess.

Magnificence is liberality at large scale, aiming at beauty and fitting grandeur in public honors (temples, sacrifices, fleets, festivals) and rare private occasions. Its expense matches the work and the work the occasion; the motive is the noble. Vulgarity overspends for show or on trifles; meanness mars results by penny-pinching.

High-mindedness concerns great honor. The high-minded rightly claim and deserve great honors, take little pleasure in lesser ones, and treat wealth and power as subordinate to honor. It presupposes complete virtue; without it, high station breeds insolence. Characteristic marks include facing great risks for great ends, conferring rather than receiving benefits, pursuing few great deeds, frankness without flattery, forgiving lightly, and a calm, measured bearing. Vanity overshoots; small-mindedness undershoots. A lesser, nameless mean concerns the right desire for honor between ambition and unambitiousness.

Gentleness is the mean about anger; excess takes many forms (quick-tempered, choleric, sulky, implacable), deficiency is slavish insensibility. Three social means govern conversation and shared life: friendliness between obsequiousness and contentiousness; truthfulness about oneself between boasting and affected understatement; and wit between buffoonery and boorishness. Shame, a fear of disgrace marked by blushing, suits youth but is not a virtue. Aristotle now turns to justice.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Liberality (virtue re: wealth) moderates giving and taking, with emphasis on giving. Wealth = things valued by money. Virtue concerns using wealth (spending/giving) more than acquiring (taking/keeping).
- The liberal person gives for the sake of the noble, to the right people, in the right amounts and times, with pleasure or at least without pain. Painful giving shows preferring money to the noble and is not liberal.
- He avoids taking from wrong sources, is reluctant to receive favors, but will take rightly (e.g., from his own resources) as a condition for giving; he manages property so he can give to the right ends. He may err slightly and feel moderate pain; he’s easy to deal with and easier to cheat, valuing noble giving over money.
- Liberality is proportionate to one’s means; small gifts can be more liberal than large ones if the giver’s fortune is small. Inherited-wealth holders tend to be more liberal than self-made. It’s hard for a liberal person to be rich (he doesn’t avidly take/keep).
- Prodigality vs. illiberality: prodigals exceed in giving/spending and are deficient in taking rightly; illiberal people are deficient in giving and excessive in taking, especially in small, petty ways.
- A “pure” prodigal (gives and abstains from taking) is closer to liberality and corrigible by age/poverty/training; most prodigals, however, also take from bad sources to fund spending, give to flatterers or for pleasure, and slide into profligacy.
- Illiberality is worse, more common, more varied, and relatively incurable; it increases with age and power-loss. Forms include miserliness (defect in giving) sometimes rationalized as “avoiding disgrace,” fearful non-taking, and base-gain pursuits (petty usury, debasing trades, cheating, theft). Large-scale unjust takers (e.g., tyrants) are termed wicked/unjust rather than merely illiberal.
- Princes are not called prodigal because their resources make exceeding “measure” hard.
- Transition: Magnificence is a distinct virtue about large expenditures, exceeding liberality in scale; what counts as “large” is relative to the undertaking (e.g., fitting out a warship vs. leading a sacred embassy).
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Closing liberality: All base ways of making money (seeking gain from improper sources/ways) are illiberal. Illiberality is the true opposite of liberality, worse and more common than prodigality.

- Magnificence (megaloprepeia):
  - A virtue about large expenditures, not all money matters. It shares liberality’s right-amount/right-manner aim but is distinguished by scale and tasteful execution.
  - “Largeness” is relative to person, occasion, and undertaking; the result should be proportional to the expense (often admirable), and the expense to the result.
  - The motive is the noble; the magnificent spend gladly, without penny-pinching, focusing on beauty and elegance like an artist.
  - Paradigmatic fields: honorific/public expenditures—worship of gods and heroes (offerings, temples, sacrifices), public services (choruses, triremes, feasts). Also rare, weighty private occasions (weddings), and civic hospitality/gifts to strangers. He spends more on lasting things; even his house is a public ornament. He does not lavish on himself.
  - Fittingness to the spender matters: the poor cannot be magnificent; it suits those with means, birth, and reputation.
  - Excess (vulgarity/bad taste): ostentatious, misdirected display—overspending on trifles, spending much where little is fitting and vice versa, for mere show.
  - Defect (meanness): under-spending that mars results via niggardly details and cost-obsession. Both vices are not gravely injurious.

- High-mindedness (megalopsychia):
  - Concerns great things, chiefly honor (the greatest external good). The high-minded person claims and deserves great honors; vanity claims more than deserved, small-mindedness less.
  - Requires complete virtue; it “crowns” and magnifies the virtues and cannot exist without them.
  - Attitude: moderately pleased by great honors from good people (still less than his due), indifferent to trivial honors, untroubled by dishonor (undeserved). Equable toward wealth, power, and fortune; thinks lightly of them since they are for honor’s sake.
  - Birth, power, wealth can make one seem high-minded, but without virtue they breed insolence/superciliousness—an unjust contempt that apes true greatness. The truly high-minded look down only with just assessment.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- High-mindedness (megalopsychia) strictly belongs only to those with complete virtue; external goods (birth, wealth, power) can make one seem high-minded but, without virtue, breed insolence and unjust contempt. The truly high-minded judge others rightly and despise only with justice.
- Traits of the high-minded:
  - Shun petty risks; face great danger for great ends, treating life as not worth clinging to at all costs.
  - Prefer conferring benefits, are ashamed to receive them, and repay with greater benefactions to restore superiority; remember what they give more than what they receive; dislike being reminded of received favors.
  - Rarely ask favors; are lofty toward the great and affable to the middling; avoid haughty treatment of the lowly.
  - Pursue few but great and notable deeds; seek honor only for truly great works.
  - Frank, truthful (with ironic reserve toward the masses), open in love and hate; won’t shape life to please others except friends; disdain flattery.
  - Hard to impress; quickly forgive and forget injuries; avoid gossip and gratuitous praise/blame; don’t lament minor or inevitable misfortunes.
  - Prefer beautiful, non-useful possessions; external demeanor: slow gait, deep voice, measured speech—reflecting that little seems very important.
- Opposed vices: little-mindedness (deficient, commoner, worse—self-undercutting misjudgment that shrinks from noble deeds) and vanity (excess—self-ignorant ostentation and overreaching).
- Lesser virtue about honor (ambition): a nameless mean between “ambitious” and “unambitious,” terms used variably in praise or blame. The mean desires honor rightly (source, manner, amount); extremes appear opposed because the mean lacks a fixed name.
- Gentleness (praotēs): mean regarding anger. The gentle person gets angry at the right things, people, times, and duration, erring slightly toward leniency. Deficiency (wrathlessness) is slavish insensibility; excess takes forms:
  - Wrathful: quick to anger and quick to cool (venting brings relief).
  - Choleric: angered at anything, too readily.
  - Sulky: bottle anger, slow to appease, burdensome to self and friends.
  - Hard-tempered: offended wrongly, excessively, enduringly; implacable without vengeance—more opposed to gentleness and worse to live with.
  - Precise measures are context-dependent; small deviations may be tolerated. The mean habit is to be aimed at; excess and defect are censured by degree.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Anger (closure): Precise measures for whom, when, how long, and how much to be angry can’t be fixed; particulars require perception. The mean—being angry at the right people/things, in the right way/time—is praised; excess and deficiency are censured in proportion to their deviation. Aim at the mean.

- Social intercourse (friendliness-like mean):
  - Between obsequiousness (always pleasing) and contentiousness (always opposing) lies a nameless mean akin to friendliness but without affection. It seeks to please and avoid pain, yet is guided by what is noble and fitting.
  - It varies by relation (great vs ordinary people, intimates vs strangers). It refuses to acquiesce when the pleasure is dishonorable or harmful, even at the cost of giving slight present pain for greater or nobler future good.
  - Excess: obsequious (for pleasing itself) or flatterer (for gain). Defect: cross/contentious.

- Truthfulness in self-presentation:
  - Mean (nameless): “always himself,” telling the plain truth about oneself in word and deed, usually inclining to understatement; praised.
  - Excess: boaster—claims esteemed qualities one lacks; worse than the deficient type. Motives: reputation (less censured) vs gain/money (more censured). The “boaster proper” boasts by habit, not merely for ends.
  - Defect: ironic self-deprecation—can be refined when moderate (avoids parade), but excessive becomes affected and contemptible; extreme understatement can resemble boasting. Boaster is the chief opposite of the truthful.

- Wit and amusement:
  - Mean: witty/tactful (eutrapelos)—makes and hears jests fitting for a gentleman; regulates by decency, akin to being a law to oneself; recognizes legal/moral limits on vilifying humor.
  - Excess: buffoon—vulgar, raises laughs at any cost, spares no one. Defect: boor—humorless, resentful of jesting. Recreation is necessary; this and the previous two means are social: one about truth, two about pleasure (amusements vs general intercourse).

- Shame (aidōs): Not a virtue but an emotion—fear of disgrace, with bodily signs—thus not a stable habit.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Closure on social virtues: There are three “means” in social interaction, all concerning conversation/joint action. One regulates truthfulness about oneself; the other two regulate pleasure—one in amusements (wit), the other in general intercourse (friendliness). Recreation is necessary, but the boor contributes nothing and takes offense at everything.

- Shame (aidōs) is not a virtue but a feeling: a fear of disgrace, evidenced by bodily signs (blushing), akin to fear of danger. As a feeling, it lacks the stable, trained character (hexis) required for virtue.

- Fitting scope: Shame suits youth, whose emotions mislead them; it restrains them from wrong. It is unfitting to praise adults for being prone to shame, since the good person should not do what merits shame.

- Normative point: Shame presupposes base voluntary acts; the good person will not voluntarily do such acts. At best, shame is “hypothetically” good (if one did wrong, one would be ashamed), but virtues are not hypothetical.

- Being shameless is bad, but doing shameful acts and then being ashamed is not good. By analogy, continence is likewise not a virtue but intermediate (to be treated later).

- Transition: Having closed these character traits, Aristotle turns to justice.
