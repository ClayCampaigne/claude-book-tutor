- Liberality (virtue re: wealth) moderates giving and taking, with emphasis on giving. Wealth = things valued by money. Virtue concerns using wealth (spending/giving) more than acquiring (taking/keeping).
- The liberal person gives for the sake of the noble, to the right people, in the right amounts and times, with pleasure or at least without pain. Painful giving shows preferring money to the noble and is not liberal.
- He avoids taking from wrong sources, is reluctant to receive favors, but will take rightly (e.g., from his own resources) as a condition for giving; he manages property so he can give to the right ends. He may err slightly and feel moderate pain; he’s easy to deal with and easier to cheat, valuing noble giving over money.
- Liberality is proportionate to one’s means; small gifts can be more liberal than large ones if the giver’s fortune is small. Inherited-wealth holders tend to be more liberal than self-made. It’s hard for a liberal person to be rich (he doesn’t avidly take/keep).
- Prodigality vs. illiberality: prodigals exceed in giving/spending and are deficient in taking rightly; illiberal people are deficient in giving and excessive in taking, especially in small, petty ways.
- A “pure” prodigal (gives and abstains from taking) is closer to liberality and corrigible by age/poverty/training; most prodigals, however, also take from bad sources to fund spending, give to flatterers or for pleasure, and slide into profligacy.
- Illiberality is worse, more common, more varied, and relatively incurable; it increases with age and power-loss. Forms include miserliness (defect in giving) sometimes rationalized as “avoiding disgrace,” fearful non-taking, and base-gain pursuits (petty usury, debasing trades, cheating, theft). Large-scale unjust takers (e.g., tyrants) are termed wicked/unjust rather than merely illiberal.
- Princes are not called prodigal because their resources make exceeding “measure” hard.
- Transition: Magnificence is a distinct virtue about large expenditures, exceeding liberality in scale; what counts as “large” is relative to the undertaking (e.g., fitting out a warship vs. leading a sacred embassy).
