- Anger (closure): Precise measures for whom, when, how long, and how much to be angry can’t be fixed; particulars require perception. The mean—being angry at the right people/things, in the right way/time—is praised; excess and deficiency are censured in proportion to their deviation. Aim at the mean.

- Social intercourse (friendliness-like mean):
  - Between obsequiousness (always pleasing) and contentiousness (always opposing) lies a nameless mean akin to friendliness but without affection. It seeks to please and avoid pain, yet is guided by what is noble and fitting.
  - It varies by relation (great vs ordinary people, intimates vs strangers). It refuses to acquiesce when the pleasure is dishonorable or harmful, even at the cost of giving slight present pain for greater or nobler future good.
  - Excess: obsequious (for pleasing itself) or flatterer (for gain). Defect: cross/contentious.

- Truthfulness in self-presentation:
  - Mean (nameless): “always himself,” telling the plain truth about oneself in word and deed, usually inclining to understatement; praised.
  - Excess: boaster—claims esteemed qualities one lacks; worse than the deficient type. Motives: reputation (less censured) vs gain/money (more censured). The “boaster proper” boasts by habit, not merely for ends.
  - Defect: ironic self-deprecation—can be refined when moderate (avoids parade), but excessive becomes affected and contemptible; extreme understatement can resemble boasting. Boaster is the chief opposite of the truthful.

- Wit and amusement:
  - Mean: witty/tactful (eutrapelos)—makes and hears jests fitting for a gentleman; regulates by decency, akin to being a law to oneself; recognizes legal/moral limits on vilifying humor.
  - Excess: buffoon—vulgar, raises laughs at any cost, spares no one. Defect: boor—humorless, resentful of jesting. Recreation is necessary; this and the previous two means are social: one about truth, two about pleasure (amusements vs general intercourse).

- Shame (aidōs): Not a virtue but an emotion—fear of disgrace, with bodily signs—thus not a stable habit.
