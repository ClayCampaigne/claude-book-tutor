- Closing liberality: All base ways of making money (seeking gain from improper sources/ways) are illiberal. Illiberality is the true opposite of liberality, worse and more common than prodigality.

- Magnificence (megaloprepeia):
  - A virtue about large expenditures, not all money matters. It shares liberality’s right-amount/right-manner aim but is distinguished by scale and tasteful execution.
  - “Largeness” is relative to person, occasion, and undertaking; the result should be proportional to the expense (often admirable), and the expense to the result.
  - The motive is the noble; the magnificent spend gladly, without penny-pinching, focusing on beauty and elegance like an artist.
  - Paradigmatic fields: honorific/public expenditures—worship of gods and heroes (offerings, temples, sacrifices), public services (choruses, triremes, feasts). Also rare, weighty private occasions (weddings), and civic hospitality/gifts to strangers. He spends more on lasting things; even his house is a public ornament. He does not lavish on himself.
  - Fittingness to the spender matters: the poor cannot be magnificent; it suits those with means, birth, and reputation.
  - Excess (vulgarity/bad taste): ostentatious, misdirected display—overspending on trifles, spending much where little is fitting and vice versa, for mere show.
  - Defect (meanness): under-spending that mars results via niggardly details and cost-obsession. Both vices are not gravely injurious.

- High-mindedness (megalopsychia):
  - Concerns great things, chiefly honor (the greatest external good). The high-minded person claims and deserves great honors; vanity claims more than deserved, small-mindedness less.
  - Requires complete virtue; it “crowns” and magnifies the virtues and cannot exist without them.
  - Attitude: moderately pleased by great honors from good people (still less than his due), indifferent to trivial honors, untroubled by dishonor (undeserved). Equable toward wealth, power, and fortune; thinks lightly of them since they are for honor’s sake.
  - Birth, power, wealth can make one seem high-minded, but without virtue they breed insolence/superciliousness—an unjust contempt that apes true greatness. The truly high-minded look down only with just assessment.
