<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter treats justice as a settled habit that makes one both do and wish just things; injustice analogously disposes to unjust things. “Just” and “unjust” are said in two main ways: lawful/lawless and fair/unfair (pleonexia, grasping more than one’s share). In the lawful sense, justice is complete virtue toward others, because good laws aim at the community’s good and command the virtues; injustice is complete vice toward others. As a part of virtue, particular justice concerns fairness about divisible external goods (honor, wealth, safety); here injustice is grasping, often for gain. All unfair is unlawful, though not all unlawful is unfair.

Particular justice divides into distributive and corrective. Distributive justice assigns common goods proportionally: equality is a proportion between persons and shares, set by the regime’s standard of merit (virtue, wealth, free birth). Wrong occurs when equals receive unequal shares or unequals equal shares. Corrective justice governs private dealings—voluntary contracts and involuntary harms—where the law treats parties as equals and restores arithmetic equality by removing the offender’s gain and making good the victim’s loss. Simple retaliation is inadequate; social cohesion depends on proportional reciprocity in exchange. Because producers and products differ in worth, exchange needs a common measure: money, a convention grounded in shared need, makes unlike goods commensurable and enables proportionate equivalence.

Justice is a mean between doing and suffering injustice (having too much and too little). Acting justly requires knowledge, choice, and fitting circumstances toward the right persons. Only voluntary acts count as just or unjust; compulsion or ignorance excuses, while deliberate wrongdoing marks an unjust character. Civic justice pertains to free and equal citizens and is partly natural (universally valid though changeable) and partly conventional. Equity (epieikeia) is not a different genus but the best form of justice: it corrects the law’s necessary generality by giving what the lawgiver would have said in the particular case. One cannot be unjust to oneself in the strict sense. Both doing and suffering injustice are bad, but doing it is worse.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Justice and injustice name habits: justice disposes one to do and wish just things; injustice to do and wish unjust things. Unlike capacities, habits produce only their characteristic results.
- The terms are multivocal: “unjust” means both lawbreaking and unfair “taking more than one’s share” (pleonexia). Accordingly, “just” means lawful and fair.
- Lawful justice: whatever accords with law is just insofar as laws aim at the community’s happiness (as conceived by the regime), prescribing acts of virtue and forbidding vice. In this sense justice is complete virtue toward others—“another’s good”—and injustice is complete vice toward others. The same character, considered relative to others, is justice; simply considered, it is virtue.
- Particular justice (a part of virtue) targets fairness in dealings with others about divisible external goods (honor, wealth, safety). Here injustice is grasping/unfairness, often motivated by gain. E.g., adultery for gain is unjust; adultery from lust is profligate, not “unjust” in this narrow sense.
- Unfairness is a subset of unlawfulness: all unfair is unlawful, not all unlawful is unfair.
- Particular justice divides into:
  - Distributive justice: fair shares of honors/wealth among citizens.
  - Corrective justice: redress in private transactions, subdivided into voluntary (sale, loan, deposit, hire) and involuntary, either secret (theft, poisoning, false witness, etc.) or violent (assault, seizure, murder, rape, slander, etc.).
- The just here is the mean as equality: a proportional equality between persons and shares, involving at least two persons and two things. Disputes arise when equals get unequal shares or unequals equal shares. “Merit” sets the proportion, but regimes disagree on the standard (democracy: free birth; oligarchy: wealth; aristocracy: virtue).

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Distributive justice: Just allocation involves four terms—two persons and two shares—arranged so person-to-person stands in the same ratio as share-to-share (a:b = c:d; alternando a:c = b:d). Distribution “joins” corresponding pairs so that the sums preserve the original ratio; this is geometrical proportion. Justice here is proportional equality; injustice is disproportion, producing “too much” for one and “too little” for the other (with lesser evils counting as “relative goods” vs greater evils).

- Corrective justice: In private transactions (voluntary and involuntary), justice is arithmetic equality, not proportional. The law treats parties as equals and looks only to the imbalance created by the wrong. The judge, as mediator, restores equality by subtracting the offender’s gain and adding to the victim’s loss, bringing both to the mean between gain and loss—returning each to what they had before.

- Reciprocity and exchange: Simple retaliation (lex talionis) is inadequate; justice in exchange requires proportional reciprocity, accounting for consent and social roles. Society coheres through proportionate return of benefits and harms. Because agents and products differ in worth (e.g., builder vs shoemaker; house vs shoes), exchanges require a common measure to equate them. Money, a conventional proxy for shared need/demand, provides this measure, enabling proportional equivalence so that quantities exchanged match the relative worth of producers. Proper adjustment should precede exchange to prevent one party securing a double advantage.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Exchange requires a common measure. The real bond is mutual need; money (nomisma, from nomos) is a conventional proxy for need/demand that makes unlike goods and labors commensurable and enables proportional reciprocity. Prices should be adjusted before exchange so the ratio of products matches the ratio of producers’ worth, avoiding a “double advantage.” Money also serves as a more stable, future-guaranteeing medium; though its value varies, it lets all things be assessed and exchanged, making society possible. Exact commensurability is impossible, but need provides a practically sufficient standard (illustrated by numerical equivalences).

- Justice is a mean between doing and suffering injustice (having too much vs too little). As a habit, it deliberately apportions proportionate shares of goods and burdens for oneself and between others; injustice chooses disproportion in both directions. Doing injustice is worse than suffering it.

- One may do unjust acts without being unjust (e.g., acts from passion vs settled choice). Civic justice concerns free, equal citizens under law; outside this (master–slave, parent–child) “justice” is only analogous, and one cannot be unjust to oneself. Magistrates should secure equality and are compensated by honor; grasping beyond this tends toward tyranny.

- Civic justice is partly natural (universally valid though changeable) and partly conventional (initially indifferent determinations). Distinguish unjust/just things from acts; δικαιοπράγμα (just doing) vs δικαίωμα (rectification).

- Acts count as unjust/just only if voluntary: within control and done with knowledge of particulars; compulsion or ignorance renders them involuntary. Some processes (aging, dying) are neither.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Acts count as just/unjust only when voluntary: within one’s control and done knowingly (person, instrument, result), without accident or compulsion. Many natural processes (aging, dying) are neither voluntary nor involuntary.
- Voluntary acts split into deliberate and non-deliberate. Ways of harming:
  - In ignorance: distinguished as mistake (no vicious intent, outcome within what could be expected; agent “sets the train in motion”) vs mishap (contrary to reasonable expectation; external interference).
  - With knowledge but without deliberation (from passion): unjust acts and “acts of injustice,” but do not mark an unjust character.
  - With set purpose: stamp the agent as unjust/wicked.
  - In disputes of passion (assaults), facts are agreed; quarrel is over right; in contracts, the factual question dominates.
- Pardonability: errors “by reason of ignorance” are pardonable; acts “in ignorance” from brutal/inhuman passion are not.
- Suffering injustice cannot be voluntary. Refine “doing injustice” to hurting another knowingly and against his wish. The incontinent does not wish his own harm; voluntary gifting (e.g., Glaucus) is not being wronged.
- Who does injustice in distributions? The prime mover (distributor) does; the receiver only if his action is voluntary in that sense. Instruments/slaves can “do” but not “act unjustly.” Judges who knowingly misjudge grasp at gain; unwitting error is not legal injustice.
- Being just is hard: not mere outward acts but acting in the right way, time, and toward the right persons (like medicine’s know-how).
- Justice concerns agents for whom common goods admit excess/defect; thus it is essentially human (not for gods or the incurably vicious).
- Transition to equity (epieikeia): the equitable is praised as “better” yet is itself a kind of just, not a different genus.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Equity (epieikeia) and justice: Equitable and just are the same in genus and both good, but the equitable is “better” insofar as it corrects the shortcomings of legal justice. Laws must speak generally and thus misfit exceptional cases; equity supplies the intended correction case-by-case—what the lawgiver would have specified if present. Hence equity is an amendment of the law where its generality fails, like a flexible “Lesbian” lead rule that adapts to irregular stones. The equitable person habitually chooses such corrections, does not press strict legal rights to others’ harm, and is willing to take less than his due; equitableness is a species of justice.

- Can one act unjustly toward oneself? In the “lawful” sense, suicide is unjust, but against the city, not oneself, since no one can be wronged voluntarily; the city rightly penalizes it. In the “particular” sense (unfair taking), injustice to oneself is impossible: unjust acts require at least two parties; the wrong must precede the harm (self-harm is simultaneous); allowing self-injustice would make voluntary suffering of injustice possible; and specific injustices (adultery, theft, burglary) conceptually target others’ goods.

- Doing vs suffering injustice: both bad, but doing is worse (blame, vice); suffering does not imply vice, though accidental circumstances can make its outcomes graver.

- Only metaphorically can “justice” apply within one person (rational vs irrational parts). Aristotle closes the treatment of justice and moral virtues.
