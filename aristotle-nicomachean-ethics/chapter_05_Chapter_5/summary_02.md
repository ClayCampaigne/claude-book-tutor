- Distributive justice: Just allocation involves four terms—two persons and two shares—arranged so person-to-person stands in the same ratio as share-to-share (a:b = c:d; alternando a:c = b:d). Distribution “joins” corresponding pairs so that the sums preserve the original ratio; this is geometrical proportion. Justice here is proportional equality; injustice is disproportion, producing “too much” for one and “too little” for the other (with lesser evils counting as “relative goods” vs greater evils).

- Corrective justice: In private transactions (voluntary and involuntary), justice is arithmetic equality, not proportional. The law treats parties as equals and looks only to the imbalance created by the wrong. The judge, as mediator, restores equality by subtracting the offender’s gain and adding to the victim’s loss, bringing both to the mean between gain and loss—returning each to what they had before.

- Reciprocity and exchange: Simple retaliation (lex talionis) is inadequate; justice in exchange requires proportional reciprocity, accounting for consent and social roles. Society coheres through proportionate return of benefits and harms. Because agents and products differ in worth (e.g., builder vs shoemaker; house vs shoes), exchanges require a common measure to equate them. Money, a conventional proxy for shared need/demand, provides this measure, enabling proportional equivalence so that quantities exchanged match the relative worth of producers. Proper adjustment should precede exchange to prevent one party securing a double advantage.
