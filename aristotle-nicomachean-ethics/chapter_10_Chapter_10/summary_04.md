- Happiness scales with contemplation: gods are supremely blessed because their activity is contemplation; humans are happy insofar as they share it. Contemplation is choiceworthy in itself, and its pleasure necessarily accompanies it.

- External goods are needed only moderately for contemplation (health, sustenance). Great wealth or rule is unnecessary; private persons often do noble deeds more than princes. Solon and Anaxagoras support a view of happy life with modest fortune and excellent action; yet practice, not theory, is the final test.

- Knowing virtue is insufficient; we must become and act virtuous. Theory can guide well-disposed youth, but most are ruled by pleasure and fear; argument cannot easily uproot entrenched passions.

- Sources of goodness: nature (not in our control), habit/training, and instruction. Instruction works only if the soul is habituated to feel pleasure and pain rightly; passion yields to force more than reason. Hence character must be formed from youth by law.

- Law is a rational, coercive regimen superior to paternal rule; exhort the noble, punish the recalcitrant (pains opposed to their loved pleasures), and maintain lifelong discipline. Sparta exemplifies civic training; most states neglect it.

- If the city fails, individuals should guide kin/friends; this requires learning the art of legislation. Education is best when individualized but grounded in universal principles, as in medicine.

- Legislating is not learned from sophists (who mistake it for rhetoric) and is not systematically taught by statesmen (who rely on experience). True political expertise needs experience plus understanding; selecting good laws is difficult and requires judgment.
