- Happiness must be an activity chosen for its own sake, not a merely necessary activity. Two candidates seem self-chosen: virtuous actions and amusements. But amusement is a restorative means for work, not the end; it is childish to toil for play. Tyrants’ and children’s preferences for bodily pastimes are not a standard. The perfect person’s judgment fixes what is truly pleasant and choiceworthy.

- Therefore happiness is serious activity in accord with virtue, not amusement or bodily pleasure (the latter are available even to slaves, who cannot share the distinctively human life).

- If happiness is virtuous activity, it is the activity of the highest virtue of the best part—reason. Hence complete happiness is contemplation (theoria):
  - Reason and its objects are highest; contemplation is most continuous, most self-sufficient, most pleasant (wisdom’s pure, steady pleasures), and desired solely for itself.
  - Happiness implies leisure; war and politics are noble but non-leisurely and for further ends.
  - Contemplation has its own proper pleasure that perfects the activity and is as inexhaustible as humanly possible; a complete life is required.

- This life is “divine” relative to our composite nature; we should live according to our ruling, truest self (reason). Moral/practical virtue yields a secondary, distinctly human happiness—interpersonal, passion-involving, requiring prudence and many externals.

- Contemplation needs few externals (basic health and sustenance); excessive goods can hinder it. Argument from the gods: the blessed divine life cannot be moral action but must be contemplation; humans are happy insofar as they share it.
