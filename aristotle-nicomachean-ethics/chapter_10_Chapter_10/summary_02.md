- Pleasure vs motion: Motion is temporally extended, part-divisible, and only complete in the whole; its parts differ by “whence–whither.” Pleasure is whole and complete at any moment, not a motion or coming-to-be (like vision or a point, it’s not divisible).

- How pleasure relates to activity: Each faculty’s best exercise on its best object is most pleasant. Pleasure “superadds” a completion to activity (distinct from the faculty’s habit or the object’s fitness), intensifying and perfecting it while the subject and object remain optimal. Continuous pleasure is impossible because continuous exertion exceeds human capacities; novelty fades as exertion relaxes.

- Life–pleasure linkage: Life is activity; pleasure completes activity. Hence all desire pleasure as the completion of the life they love. Pleasure and activity are inseparable in practice.

- Pleasures differ in kind: Different activities have distinct, closely “fitted” pleasures; proper pleasure heightens its activity, while alien pleasure impedes it (e.g., flute-music distracts reasoning), almost like proper pain. As activities vary in goodness, so do their pleasures: pleasures of good activities are good; of base activities, bad. Intellectual pleasures are “purer” than sensory; among senses, sight > touch; hearing/smell > taste.

- Species- and character-relativity: Each being has its proper pleasures; within humans, the virtuous person is the standard—what seems pleasant to him truly is. Base “pleasures” count as such only to the corrupt.

- Transition to happiness: Happiness is an activity, not a habit; it must be self-sufficient and chosen for its own sake—candidates include virtuous actions and amusements (the latter prized by many and by tyrants), foreshadowing a critique of identifying happiness with amusement.
