- Observation about practitioners and teaching: Statesmen neither write about nor transmit the legislative craft to sons or friends; if they could, they would, since no better legacy exists. Their success seems largely empirical. Hence experience is necessary for statesmanship, but experience alone is insufficient.

- Critique of sophists and “easy” methods: Sophists misidentify politics with or subordinate it to rhetoric and suppose that compiling “the best” laws suffices. They overlook that judging and selecting laws require understanding; evaluation is hardest here, as in music, where only trained practitioners can discern how elements fit harmoniously.

- Limits of compendia: Laws are the product of statesmanship; a mere collection cannot teach one to legislate or even to pick the best. By analogy with medicine, handbooks help only those already trained; to the untrained, they are largely useless, though they may sharpen awareness.

- Programmatic turn: Because predecessors left legislation largely unexamined, Aristotle proposes to complete the ethical inquiry by:
  - Reviewing prior valuable statements.
  - Studying a collection of constitutions to identify:
    - What preserves or destroys states in general.
    - What preserves or destroys each regime-type.
    - Causes of good governance and misrule.
  - From this, determine the best constitution and the best arrangement within each type—i.e., the laws and customs suited to each.
