- Aim: Reassess pleasure’s nature and value because it steers education and character; reject “noble lies” that call pleasure bad—truthful accounts better guide action.

- Eudoxus’ pro-pleasure arguments:
  - Universal pursuit: all beings seek pleasure; what all desire is (at least some) good.
  - Pain is universally shunned; its contrary is desirable.
  - Pleasure is chosen for its own sake (needs no further rationale).
  - Adding pleasure makes other goods more choiceworthy.
  - Aristotle grants these show pleasure is good, but not that pleasure is the Good.

- Replies to anti-pleasure objections:
  - Plato’s “addition” point shows pleasure isn’t the ultimate Good; Aristotle agrees the Good must be unaugmentable yet shareable.
  - Dismissing common opinion is irrational, since both rational and irrational seek pleasure.
  - Opposite-of-evil objection fails here: people in fact choose pleasure as good and shun pain as bad.
  - “Indeterminate” charge: more/less applies to virtues and to health; pleasure can vary yet be a determinate good.
  - Pleasure is not motion or coming-to-be: motions require time and are incomplete until an end; pleasure is complete at any moment.
  - “Replenishment” theory (pleasure as bodily restoration) is limited to nutritive cases; many pleasures lack antecedent pain (e.g., learning, sight, sound, smell, memory, hope).

- On base pleasures:
  - Either not truly pleasant (relative to the corrupted state), or pleasant but not choiceworthy due to source, or pleasures differ by kind and track the agent’s state—only the just feel just pleasures.
  - Flatterer vs true friend shows ends differ: mere pleasure vs the good.

- Conclusion so far: Pleasure is not the Good; not all pleasures are choiceworthy. Some pleasures are good and differ in kind; pleasure is a complete, momentary activity, not a process.
