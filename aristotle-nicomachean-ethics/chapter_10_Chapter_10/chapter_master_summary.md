<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
The chapter reassesses pleasure’s nature and worth without “noble lies,” arguing that only a truthful account can guide education and character. Following Eudoxus, Aristotle notes that all beings pursue pleasure and shun pain; pleasure is chosen for its own sake and augments other goods—showing pleasure is a good, though not the Good. He rebuts objections: it is irrational to dismiss common opinion; pleasure can be determinate despite “more/less,” as with health; pleasure is not motion or coming-to-be, since it is complete at any moment; and the “replenishment” theory fits only bodily restorations, whereas many pleasures have no prior lack. Apparent “base pleasures” either are pleasant only to the corrupted, are not choiceworthy because of their source, or differ in kind in ways that track the agent’s condition. The virtuous person sets the standard for what is truly pleasant.

Pleasure completes activity: each power’s best exercise on its best object is most pleasant, and pleasure “superadds” a perfection that intensifies the activity while conditions remain optimal. Hence life (activity) and pleasure are practically inseparable. Pleasures differ by kind and “fit” their activities: proper pleasure enhances its own activity and alien pleasures impede others. As activities vary in goodness, so do their pleasures; intellectual pleasures are purer than sensory, and among senses sight outranks touch.

Happiness must be an activity chosen for its own sake. Amusement, prized by many and by tyrants, is for restoration and is not an end; it is childish to toil for play. Happiness is serious activity in accord with virtue, and in its highest form contemplation: reason and its objects are supreme; contemplation is most continuous, self-sufficient, pleasant, leisured, and desired for itself. It needs few externals; moral-practical virtue yields a secondary, human happiness that depends more on fortune.

Because knowing is not enough, character must be formed from youth by law: habituation to feel pleasure and pain rightly, exhorting the tractable and coercing the recalcitrant. Sophists mistake legislation for rhetoric, and statesmen rely on untaught experience. Aristotle therefore proposes to complete the inquiry by studying constitutions to learn what preserves and ruins regimes, and to determine the best constitution and laws—preparing the way for political science.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Aim: Reassess pleasure’s nature and value because it steers education and character; reject “noble lies” that call pleasure bad—truthful accounts better guide action.

- Eudoxus’ pro-pleasure arguments:
  - Universal pursuit: all beings seek pleasure; what all desire is (at least some) good.
  - Pain is universally shunned; its contrary is desirable.
  - Pleasure is chosen for its own sake (needs no further rationale).
  - Adding pleasure makes other goods more choiceworthy.
  - Aristotle grants these show pleasure is good, but not that pleasure is the Good.

- Replies to anti-pleasure objections:
  - Plato’s “addition” point shows pleasure isn’t the ultimate Good; Aristotle agrees the Good must be unaugmentable yet shareable.
  - Dismissing common opinion is irrational, since both rational and irrational seek pleasure.
  - Opposite-of-evil objection fails here: people in fact choose pleasure as good and shun pain as bad.
  - “Indeterminate” charge: more/less applies to virtues and to health; pleasure can vary yet be a determinate good.
  - Pleasure is not motion or coming-to-be: motions require time and are incomplete until an end; pleasure is complete at any moment.
  - “Replenishment” theory (pleasure as bodily restoration) is limited to nutritive cases; many pleasures lack antecedent pain (e.g., learning, sight, sound, smell, memory, hope).

- On base pleasures:
  - Either not truly pleasant (relative to the corrupted state), or pleasant but not choiceworthy due to source, or pleasures differ by kind and track the agent’s state—only the just feel just pleasures.
  - Flatterer vs true friend shows ends differ: mere pleasure vs the good.

- Conclusion so far: Pleasure is not the Good; not all pleasures are choiceworthy. Some pleasures are good and differ in kind; pleasure is a complete, momentary activity, not a process.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Pleasure vs motion: Motion is temporally extended, part-divisible, and only complete in the whole; its parts differ by “whence–whither.” Pleasure is whole and complete at any moment, not a motion or coming-to-be (like vision or a point, it’s not divisible).

- How pleasure relates to activity: Each faculty’s best exercise on its best object is most pleasant. Pleasure “superadds” a completion to activity (distinct from the faculty’s habit or the object’s fitness), intensifying and perfecting it while the subject and object remain optimal. Continuous pleasure is impossible because continuous exertion exceeds human capacities; novelty fades as exertion relaxes.

- Life–pleasure linkage: Life is activity; pleasure completes activity. Hence all desire pleasure as the completion of the life they love. Pleasure and activity are inseparable in practice.

- Pleasures differ in kind: Different activities have distinct, closely “fitted” pleasures; proper pleasure heightens its activity, while alien pleasure impedes it (e.g., flute-music distracts reasoning), almost like proper pain. As activities vary in goodness, so do their pleasures: pleasures of good activities are good; of base activities, bad. Intellectual pleasures are “purer” than sensory; among senses, sight > touch; hearing/smell > taste.

- Species- and character-relativity: Each being has its proper pleasures; within humans, the virtuous person is the standard—what seems pleasant to him truly is. Base “pleasures” count as such only to the corrupt.

- Transition to happiness: Happiness is an activity, not a habit; it must be self-sufficient and chosen for its own sake—candidates include virtuous actions and amusements (the latter prized by many and by tyrants), foreshadowing a critique of identifying happiness with amusement.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Happiness must be an activity chosen for its own sake, not a merely necessary activity. Two candidates seem self-chosen: virtuous actions and amusements. But amusement is a restorative means for work, not the end; it is childish to toil for play. Tyrants’ and children’s preferences for bodily pastimes are not a standard. The perfect person’s judgment fixes what is truly pleasant and choiceworthy.

- Therefore happiness is serious activity in accord with virtue, not amusement or bodily pleasure (the latter are available even to slaves, who cannot share the distinctively human life).

- If happiness is virtuous activity, it is the activity of the highest virtue of the best part—reason. Hence complete happiness is contemplation (theoria):
  - Reason and its objects are highest; contemplation is most continuous, most self-sufficient, most pleasant (wisdom’s pure, steady pleasures), and desired solely for itself.
  - Happiness implies leisure; war and politics are noble but non-leisurely and for further ends.
  - Contemplation has its own proper pleasure that perfects the activity and is as inexhaustible as humanly possible; a complete life is required.

- This life is “divine” relative to our composite nature; we should live according to our ruling, truest self (reason). Moral/practical virtue yields a secondary, distinctly human happiness—interpersonal, passion-involving, requiring prudence and many externals.

- Contemplation needs few externals (basic health and sustenance); excessive goods can hinder it. Argument from the gods: the blessed divine life cannot be moral action but must be contemplation; humans are happy insofar as they share it.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Happiness scales with contemplation: gods are supremely blessed because their activity is contemplation; humans are happy insofar as they share it. Contemplation is choiceworthy in itself, and its pleasure necessarily accompanies it.

- External goods are needed only moderately for contemplation (health, sustenance). Great wealth or rule is unnecessary; private persons often do noble deeds more than princes. Solon and Anaxagoras support a view of happy life with modest fortune and excellent action; yet practice, not theory, is the final test.

- Knowing virtue is insufficient; we must become and act virtuous. Theory can guide well-disposed youth, but most are ruled by pleasure and fear; argument cannot easily uproot entrenched passions.

- Sources of goodness: nature (not in our control), habit/training, and instruction. Instruction works only if the soul is habituated to feel pleasure and pain rightly; passion yields to force more than reason. Hence character must be formed from youth by law.

- Law is a rational, coercive regimen superior to paternal rule; exhort the noble, punish the recalcitrant (pains opposed to their loved pleasures), and maintain lifelong discipline. Sparta exemplifies civic training; most states neglect it.

- If the city fails, individuals should guide kin/friends; this requires learning the art of legislation. Education is best when individualized but grounded in universal principles, as in medicine.

- Legislating is not learned from sophists (who mistake it for rhetoric) and is not systematically taught by statesmen (who rely on experience). True political expertise needs experience plus understanding; selecting good laws is difficult and requires judgment.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Observation about practitioners and teaching: Statesmen neither write about nor transmit the legislative craft to sons or friends; if they could, they would, since no better legacy exists. Their success seems largely empirical. Hence experience is necessary for statesmanship, but experience alone is insufficient.

- Critique of sophists and “easy” methods: Sophists misidentify politics with or subordinate it to rhetoric and suppose that compiling “the best” laws suffices. They overlook that judging and selecting laws require understanding; evaluation is hardest here, as in music, where only trained practitioners can discern how elements fit harmoniously.

- Limits of compendia: Laws are the product of statesmanship; a mere collection cannot teach one to legislate or even to pick the best. By analogy with medicine, handbooks help only those already trained; to the untrained, they are largely useless, though they may sharpen awareness.

- Programmatic turn: Because predecessors left legislation largely unexamined, Aristotle proposes to complete the ethical inquiry by:
  - Reviewing prior valuable statements.
  - Studying a collection of constitutions to identify:
    - What preserves or destroys states in general.
    - What preserves or destroys each regime-type.
    - Causes of good governance and misrule.
  - From this, determine the best constitution and the best arrangement within each type—i.e., the laws and customs suited to each.
