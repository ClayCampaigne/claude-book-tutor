- Why benefactors love more: Present self-actualization is the most pleasant and lovable; for benefactors, the beautiful deed endures, while the recipient’s advantage quickly fades. Memories of noble actions are pleasant; of merely profitable ones, not or less so. Loving is an active doing, being loved a passive receiving—those with the better, active part love more. Toil heightens attachment; hence benefactors—and especially mothers, who labor more and are surer of maternity—love more than recipients or fathers.

- Self-love clarified: The apparent clash—blaming “self-lovers” yet claiming one should love oneself most—is resolved by distinguishing kinds of self-love. Vulgar self-love grasps at money, honors, and bodily pleasures (the irrational part’s aims) and is rightly reproached. True self-love gratifies the ruling rational part by choosing the noble. The good person is most truly self-loving: reason identifies what is best for itself; by doing the noble he benefits both self and others, even surrendering wealth, honors, offices, or life for grandly noble ends (including letting a friend perform the deed when nobler). In all praised cases he “takes the larger share” of the noble.

- Do the happy need friends? Yes—though not primarily for utility or extra pleasure. Happiness is ongoing virtuous activity, easier and more continuous with friends; humans are social; beneficence needs recipients; and the good delight in contemplating friends’ good (as “their own”). Life is activity, and consciousness of living/acting is intrinsically pleasant—augmented through shared virtuous friendship.
