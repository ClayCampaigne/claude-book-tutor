<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Aristotle examines friendships of utility, pleasure, and virtue, showing how equality is maintained: in unequal bonds, proportional exchange preserves fairness, as in civic trade where money measures returns. Utility- and pleasure-friendships are fragile: disputes arise when partners seek different ends or when the sought good disappears; they loved an incidental feature, not the person, so the tie dissolves. Fairness turns on the end each sought, as in the “harper” case: mismatched aims breed grievance.

Reciprocation depends on motive. Benefits freely given for the other’s sake create no strict claim; one should repay in line with the giver’s purpose, as with debts to parents, gods, or teachers, where exact equivalence is impossible—doing what is possible suffices. Where return is expected, agreement on proportion is best; otherwise the recipient should judge the value (ideally the pre-benefit estimate), since voluntary contracts rest on trust and givers overrate what is theirs. Prepaid promises left unfulfilled are blameworthy.

Conflicting claims admit no formula; weigh nobility, necessity, and urgency. Generally repay prior benefits before new favors, yet ransom a father first and do not aid the notoriously wicked. Different relations owe different dues: parents chiefly deserve sustenance and honor; elders deference; siblings and comrades sharing and frank speech; honors and aid are distributed to kin, tribesmen, and citizens by closeness and merit or usefulness.

Ending is natural when utility or pleasure ceases; deception about motives is shameful. One may withdraw from the bad, though reformable friends should be helped; great disparities of virtue make shared life impossible, yet past friendship warrants some consideration.

Friendship mirrors self-relation. The good are unified, wish and do genuine good for their rational “self,” enjoy their own company, and thus can wish and do good for a friend—a “second self”—sharing life, choices, joys, and griefs. The vicious lack self-friendship, being at odds with themselves.

Well-wishing is a friendly seed that can grow into character-friendship; unanimity is a civic friendship: agreement on shared practical goods.

Benefactors love more than beneficiaries, not as creditors, but because benefaction realizes their activity; loving is active, being loved passive, and toil deepens attachment (as with mothers).

True self-love honors the ruling rational part by choosing the noble; vulgar self-love chases wealth, honor, and pleasure. The good, most truly self-loving, even surrender external goods or life for great nobility, taking the larger share of what is fine.

The happy need friends not for extra utility or pleasure, but to sustain continuous virtuous activity, exercise beneficence, and contemplate friends’ good as their own; life is activity, and awareness of one’s and a friend’s living is intrinsically pleasant. Hence one needs a few good friends—few enough to live together; many utility-friends only as one can reciprocate; pleasure-friends like “sweets,” sparingly.

In prosperity invite friends to share; in adversity summon them only if their help greatly relieves with little burden. Go unasked to aid distressed friends; assist prosperous friends without eagerness to receive benefits.

Living together shapes character: we share the activities we take to be life—drink and play for the base, thoughtful action for the good. Bad friendships corrupt by reinforcing vice; good friendships improve through shared virtuous activity and mutual correction, and are most pleasant for that reason.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- In unequal (dissimilar) friendships, equality is preserved by proportional exchange, akin to civic exchange where money provides a common measure. In pleasure- or utility-based ties, disputes arise when partners seek different ends (pleasure vs profit) or when the sought good ceases; such friendships dissolve because they loved a contingent attribute, not the person. The “harper” case shows fairness depends on the end each sought; mismatch breeds grievance.

- Valuing services:
  - If a benefit was freely given for the other’s sake (virtue-friendship), no claim arises; reciprocation should follow the giver’s purpose, and like debts to parents, gods, or teachers, exact equivalence is impossible—“the possible” suffices.
  - If given expecting return, ideally both agree on proportion; failing that, the recipient should assess the value (preferably by the pre-benefit estimate), since voluntary contracts hinge on trust and givers overvalue what is theirs. Prepaid promises unfulfilled are blameworthy.

- Conflicting obligations admit no rigid rule; weigh nobility, necessity, and urgency. Generally repay debts/benefits before new favors, but exceptions (e.g., ransom a father first; don’t aid a known bad person). Different relations carry distinct dues: parents chiefly merit sustenance and fitting honor; elders deference; brothers/comrades share and frankness; distribute honors/aid to kin, tribesmen, citizens by closeness and merit/usefulness.

- Ending friendships: utility/pleasure ties naturally end with their basis; deception about motives is blameworthy. If a friend becomes bad, withdrawal is reasonable, though reformable friends should be helped morally. Large disparities of virtue (e.g., one matures, the other remains childish) make shared life impossible; still, past friendship warrants some consideration unless extreme depravity.

- Friendship’s features mirror self-relation: the good person is of one mind with himself, wills and does genuine good for his rational self, and thus provides the standard for friendship.

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Friendship’s marks (wishing and doing the other’s good for the other’s sake; wishing the friend’s continued existence; sharing life, choices, joys, and griefs) mirror the good person’s relation to himself. The good are unified in desire and judgment, act for what truly is and seems good, chiefly for the rational element (the truer “self”), enjoy their own company, have pleasant memories and hopeful prospects, and are consistent in pleasures and pains. Hence a friend is a “second self.” The vicious lack self-friendship: they are internally divided (desire vs belief), avoid solitude, feel remorse, even hate life; thus one must pursue virtue to be friendly to oneself and to others.

- Well-wishing (eunoia) is friendly but not yet friendship: it can arise quickly toward perceived excellence (e.g., athletes), lacks love’s desire and effort, and may exist without mutual awareness. It is the seed that, with time and intimacy, can grow into character-based friendship; it is not constitutive of utility or pleasure friendships.

- Unanimity (homonoia) is a civic form of friendship: agreement about shared, practical goods and coordinated action under the same conditions. It characterizes good citizens whose wishes are stable and just; the base, seeking private advantage while shirking burdens, generate discord.

- Benefactors love beneficiaries more than the reverse, not as creditors seeking repayment, but because doing benefits is a self-actualization. We love what manifests our activity (as craftsmen their works, poets their poems); the benefactor sees a beautiful, enduring deed, while the beneficiary chiefly sees transient utility. Loving aligns with doing (the better part), and toil increases affection (e.g., mothers’ greater love).
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Why benefactors love more: Present self-actualization is the most pleasant and lovable; for benefactors, the beautiful deed endures, while the recipient’s advantage quickly fades. Memories of noble actions are pleasant; of merely profitable ones, not or less so. Loving is an active doing, being loved a passive receiving—those with the better, active part love more. Toil heightens attachment; hence benefactors—and especially mothers, who labor more and are surer of maternity—love more than recipients or fathers.

- Self-love clarified: The apparent clash—blaming “self-lovers” yet claiming one should love oneself most—is resolved by distinguishing kinds of self-love. Vulgar self-love grasps at money, honors, and bodily pleasures (the irrational part’s aims) and is rightly reproached. True self-love gratifies the ruling rational part by choosing the noble. The good person is most truly self-loving: reason identifies what is best for itself; by doing the noble he benefits both self and others, even surrendering wealth, honors, offices, or life for grandly noble ends (including letting a friend perform the deed when nobler). In all praised cases he “takes the larger share” of the noble.

- Do the happy need friends? Yes—though not primarily for utility or extra pleasure. Happiness is ongoing virtuous activity, easier and more continuous with friends; humans are social; beneficence needs recipients; and the good delight in contemplating friends’ good (as “their own”). Life is activity, and consciousness of living/acting is intrinsically pleasant—augmented through shared virtuous friendship.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Why the happy need friends (continued): Life is essentially activity (perceiving/thinking), and we are conscious of our activities; consciousness of life is intrinsically pleasant because life is naturally good. The good person’s own existence is thus pleasant to him. Since a friend is “another self,” the good likewise desire their friend’s existence and the consciousness of it, realized by living together in rational companionship. Therefore, the happy person needs good friends to complete his life.

- How many friends: 
  - Utility-friends: only as many as one can appropriately reciprocate; excess hinders noble living.
  - Pleasure-friends: few, like “sweets” in a diet.
  - Virtue-friends: limited by the capacity to live together; they should also be friends with one another; one cannot ardently befriend many. Civic friendliness can extend broadly, but character-friendship is rare and few.

- Friends in prosperity/adversity:
  - We need them in both; aid is more pressing in misfortune, but friendship is nobler in prosperity (doing good, sharing life).
  - Presence eases grief (by sweet companionship and sympathy) but can also pain if we cause them sorrow; the noble avoid burdening friends unless relief outweighs this.
  - Invite friends to share prosperity; be slow to summon them in adversity unless their help will greatly relieve with little trouble. Conversely, go unasked to help friends in distress; assist prosperous friends but don’t be eager to receive benefits; avoid seeming ungracious.

- Living together shapes character: Friends naturally share the activities they take to be “life” (drinking, games, exercise, hunting, philosophy). Bad people’s friendships corrupt by reinforcing vice; good people’s friendships improve both through shared virtuous activity and mutual correction—each becoming more like what he approves in the other. Transition to pleasure follows.
