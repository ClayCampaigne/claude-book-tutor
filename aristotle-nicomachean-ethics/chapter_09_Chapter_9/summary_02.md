- Friendship’s marks (wishing and doing the other’s good for the other’s sake; wishing the friend’s continued existence; sharing life, choices, joys, and griefs) mirror the good person’s relation to himself. The good are unified in desire and judgment, act for what truly is and seems good, chiefly for the rational element (the truer “self”), enjoy their own company, have pleasant memories and hopeful prospects, and are consistent in pleasures and pains. Hence a friend is a “second self.” The vicious lack self-friendship: they are internally divided (desire vs belief), avoid solitude, feel remorse, even hate life; thus one must pursue virtue to be friendly to oneself and to others.

- Well-wishing (eunoia) is friendly but not yet friendship: it can arise quickly toward perceived excellence (e.g., athletes), lacks love’s desire and effort, and may exist without mutual awareness. It is the seed that, with time and intimacy, can grow into character-based friendship; it is not constitutive of utility or pleasure friendships.

- Unanimity (homonoia) is a civic form of friendship: agreement about shared, practical goods and coordinated action under the same conditions. It characterizes good citizens whose wishes are stable and just; the base, seeking private advantage while shirking burdens, generate discord.

- Benefactors love beneficiaries more than the reverse, not as creditors seeking repayment, but because doing benefits is a self-actualization. We love what manifests our activity (as craftsmen their works, poets their poems); the benefactor sees a beautiful, enduring deed, while the beneficiary chiefly sees transient utility. Loving aligns with doing (the better part), and toil increases affection (e.g., mothers’ greater love).
