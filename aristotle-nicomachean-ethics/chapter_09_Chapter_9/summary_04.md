- Why the happy need friends (continued): Life is essentially activity (perceiving/thinking), and we are conscious of our activities; consciousness of life is intrinsically pleasant because life is naturally good. The good person’s own existence is thus pleasant to him. Since a friend is “another self,” the good likewise desire their friend’s existence and the consciousness of it, realized by living together in rational companionship. Therefore, the happy person needs good friends to complete his life.

- How many friends: 
  - Utility-friends: only as many as one can appropriately reciprocate; excess hinders noble living.
  - Pleasure-friends: few, like “sweets” in a diet.
  - Virtue-friends: limited by the capacity to live together; they should also be friends with one another; one cannot ardently befriend many. Civic friendliness can extend broadly, but character-friendship is rare and few.

- Friends in prosperity/adversity:
  - We need them in both; aid is more pressing in misfortune, but friendship is nobler in prosperity (doing good, sharing life).
  - Presence eases grief (by sweet companionship and sympathy) but can also pain if we cause them sorrow; the noble avoid burdening friends unless relief outweighs this.
  - Invite friends to share prosperity; be slow to summon them in adversity unless their help will greatly relieve with little trouble. Conversely, go unasked to help friends in distress; assist prosperous friends but don’t be eager to receive benefits; avoid seeming ungracious.

- Living together shapes character: Friends naturally share the activities they take to be “life” (drinking, games, exercise, hunting, philosophy). Bad people’s friendships corrupt by reinforcing vice; good people’s friendships improve both through shared virtuous activity and mutual correction—each becoming more like what he approves in the other. Transition to pleasure follows.
