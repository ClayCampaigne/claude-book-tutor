<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Friendship is necessary and noble, the groundwork of private flourishing and political concord. Legislators prize it even more than justice, and where justice is perfect it coincides with friendship. Love aims at what is lovable—the good, the pleasant, or the useful (as a means); people love what appears good or pleasant for themselves. Friendship, however, requires reciprocal well-wishing for the other’s sake with mutual awareness; it cannot exist toward inanimate things.

There are three kinds of friendship, mirroring these motives. Utility-friendship loves the other as useful; it is common among the old, intermittent, and dissolves when advantage ends. Pleasure-friendship loves the other as pleasant; common among the young and erotic ties, it seeks living together but is unstable as pleasures change—unless it ripens into esteem for character. Virtue-friendship is “perfect”: good people alike in excellence love one another for who they are; it is at once useful and pleasant, most stable, resistant to slander, trusting and non-injurious, yet rare and slow, requiring tested time. Bad people can share utility or pleasure, not virtue.

Friendship is a stable habit whose activity is shared life: friends delight in the same things and benefit one another when together; distance suspends activity (not the disposition), though long absence erodes it. True friendships are few; in perfect friendship love and benefits are equal—each loves his own good by loving a good friend.

Equality governs friendship. Among equals, love should be equal; among unequals (parent–child, elder–younger, husband–wife, ruler–subject), returns are proportionate to worth, creating fitting equality. Friendship resides more in loving than being loved; proportional loving stabilizes unequal bonds. Similarity in virtue best sustains friendship; bad men’s ties are fickle and vice-based. Utility often unites “opposites” (rich–poor, lover–beloved), spawning absurd demands for equal love when partners are not equally lovable.

Friendship and justice coextend across associations; stronger friendship heightens justice’s claims and makes injustices graver. Political constitutions and families mirror this: kingship/parenthood shows the most friendship; brothers and comrades share equally; corrupt regimes, especially tyranny, have least. With slaves or tools, there is no friendship as such, though minimal justice/friendship arises insofar as they participate as humans, greatest in democracies through equality.

Kinship friendships root in origin: parents love children as a second self (mothers most), children love parents later as their source; siblings love from shared blood and upbringing. Spousal friendship is natural—aimed at procreation and life’s needs—mixing utility and pleasure and capable of virtue; children bind, childless marriages dissolve more easily. Quarrels chiefly afflict utility ties. In utility friendships, clarify terms: contractual exchanges invite fewer disputes; in discretionary giving, people reframe gifts as loans. Repay if able; in utility, measure return by the recipient’s benefit; in virtue, by the benefactor’s purpose. In unequal friendships, honor is due to the virtuous/useful and material aid to the needy; repay in the “currency” you can. Debts to gods and parents are unrepayable; sons should not disown fathers, though fathers might disown sons—rarely.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Friendship is necessary, noble, and foundational for private life and political concord; legislators prize it even more than justice, and perfect justice coincides with friendship. It supports prosperity, secures power, is refuge in misfortune, assists youth, old age, and noble action, and is natural in kin and fellow humans.
- Love targets what is lovable: the good, the pleasant, or the useful (useful as a means to good/pleasure). People love what is (or seems) good/pleasant for themselves.
- Friendship requires mutual well-wishing for the other’s sake with reciprocal awareness; unilateral well-wishing is not yet friendship. One cannot be friends with inanimate things.
- Three kinds of friendship correspond to the three motives:
  - Utility: each loves the other as useful to oneself; common among the old and in host–guest ties; intermittent contact; easily dissolved when advantage ends.
  - Pleasure: each loves the other as pleasant; common among the young and in erotic ties; seeks living together; unstable as pleasures/change (e.g., beauty fades) unless it matures into character-based regard.
  - Virtue (“perfect friendship”): between good people alike in excellence, each loving the other for who they are; mutually good, pleasant, and useful; most stable, resistant to slander, marked by trust and non-injury; rare and requires long, tested familiarity (“salt” proverb).
- Friendships endure best when both receive the same thing from the same source; only the virtuous kind is primary, the others are called friendships by resemblance. Bad people can form utility/pleasure friendships, not virtue-friendships.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Only virtue-based friendship is secure: it resists slander, entails mutual trust and non-injury, and is “friendship simply.” Utility- and pleasure-based ties are “friendships” by resemblance (since they involve some good/pleasant), are contingent, and rarely coincide in the same pair.
- Friendship as activity vs disposition: when together, friends delight in and benefit each other; distance halts the exercise but not the disposition. Prolonged absence erodes friendship. Living together, shared pleasures, and liking the same things are characteristic; mere well-wishing without shared life is not full friendship.
- Friendship is a stable habit, not mere feeling. Love can target inanimate things, but friendship requires purpose and reciprocal wishing well for the other’s sake. In perfect friendship, benefits and love are equal; each loves his own good by loving a good friend.
- True friendships are few: they demand intensity, testing, and rarity of worthy partners. Pleasure-friendships resemble virtue-friendships more than utility ones. The happy seek pleasant companions for shared life, but ought also seek friends who are good and good for them.
- High-status people split friends into useful and pleasant; uniting both is rare. A good man is both pleasant and useful, but won’t befriend a superior unless he accepts inferiority in virtue to equalize the relation—something great men rarely do.
- Unequal friendships (parent–child, elder–younger, husband–wife, ruler–subject) differ by roles and excellences; reciprocity should be proportionate to desert, creating an equality suited to friendship. Extreme disparities (with gods, princes) preclude friendship.
- One should wish a friend the greatest goods compatible with his remaining human.
- Being loved is better than being honored; friendship lies more in loving. The virtue of a friend is to love proportionately to worth. Similarity in virtue stabilizes friendship and restrains wrongdoing; bad men’s friendships are fleeting and vice-based.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Friendship resides more in loving than in being loved; thus the friend’s virtue is to love. Proportionate loving (according to each person’s worth) stabilizes friendships and equalizes unequal partners. Similarity in virtue best sustains friendship, since good people are stable, restrain each other from wrong, and neither demand nor do unworthy things. Bad people’s ties are unstable and vice-based. Utility/pleasure friendships last only while benefit/pleasure endures. Utility friendships often unite opposites (rich–poor, learned–ignorant; lover–beloved), prompting absurd demands for equal love when partners aren’t equally lovable; desire for “opposites” is really for the mean.

- Friendship and justice coextend: every association affords a measure of both, proportional to the partnership’s scope. “Friends’ goods are common” captures the communal aspect; stronger friendships heighten justice’s claims and make injustices graver (e.g., wronging a comrade worse than a fellow-citizen). All associations are parts of the political community, which aims at the common good over a whole life; kinds of friendship track kinds of associations.

- Constitutions and their corruptions: kingship (best) → tyranny (worst); aristocracy → oligarchy; timocracy (property-based, weakest of the correct) → democracy (least bad corruption). Family analogues: father–son = kingship (or Persian tyranny); master–slave = tyranny; husband–wife = aristocracy (degrades to oligarchy if rule not by merit); brothers = timocracy; masterless/weak households resemble democracy.

- Friendship mirrors justice within regimes: most in kingship/parental relations (benefits flow down; honor and claims proportioned), equal-sharing among brothers/comrades/timocracies; little in corrupt forms, least in tyranny. No friendship/justice with tools or slaves as such; but insofar as slaves are human participants in law/contract, some minimal justice/friendship exists, greatest among corrupt forms in democracies due to equality.

- Kinship friendship roots in parent–child: parents love children as part of themselves (immediately, and mothers more); children love parents as their source (later, with understanding). Siblings love from shared origin (“same blood”).
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Kinship friendships are asymmetric and rooted in origin. Parents love children as “a second self,” earlier and more intensely (they know the child first; what proceeds from us “belongs” to us), with mothers loving most; children love parents as their source, later, with understanding. Siblings love from common origin (“same blood”), strengthened by shared upbringing and age; their bond resembles comradeship. Other kinship ties vary in closeness with genealogical proximity. Children’s love for parents (like men’s for gods) targets a superior source of life, nurture, and education, yielding greater pleasure and benefit with greater shared life.

- Spousal friendship is natural: the household precedes the state; humans pair not only to procreate but to meet life’s needs via complementary roles. It mixes pleasure and utility and can be virtue-based if both are good. Children bind spouses; childless marriages dissolve more readily. Questions about how spouses/friends should live together are matters of justice appropriate to each relationship.

- In all three friendship types (virtue, pleasure, utility), there are equal and unequal cases: equals should love equally; unequals should render proportionate to merit.

- Quarrels chiefly afflict utility friendships. Virtue-friendships aim at benefitting each other and lack reproach; pleasure-friendships are voluntary, so complaint is silly.

- Utility friendships: two bases mirror written/unwritten justice.
  - Contractual: specified terms, either strict (cash) or deferred quid pro quo; fewer disputes if terms are clear.
  - Dispositional: gifts given “as a friend” later treated as loans, causing accusations. Since people prefer profit to the noble, clarify terms upfront. Repay if able; in utility, measure return by the recipient’s benefit; in virtue-friendships, by the benefactor’s purpose.

- Unequal friendships: both superior and needy have valid claims, but to different goods—honor to the virtuous/useful; material aid to the needy. Constitutions mirror this. Interpersonally, repay in the currency you can (honor or money). Friendship asks what is possible, not the impossible debts owed to gods and parents; sons can never fully repay, so may not disown fathers, though fathers could disown sons (rarely).
