- Friendship resides more in loving than in being loved; thus the friend’s virtue is to love. Proportionate loving (according to each person’s worth) stabilizes friendships and equalizes unequal partners. Similarity in virtue best sustains friendship, since good people are stable, restrain each other from wrong, and neither demand nor do unworthy things. Bad people’s ties are unstable and vice-based. Utility/pleasure friendships last only while benefit/pleasure endures. Utility friendships often unite opposites (rich–poor, learned–ignorant; lover–beloved), prompting absurd demands for equal love when partners aren’t equally lovable; desire for “opposites” is really for the mean.

- Friendship and justice coextend: every association affords a measure of both, proportional to the partnership’s scope. “Friends’ goods are common” captures the communal aspect; stronger friendships heighten justice’s claims and make injustices graver (e.g., wronging a comrade worse than a fellow-citizen). All associations are parts of the political community, which aims at the common good over a whole life; kinds of friendship track kinds of associations.

- Constitutions and their corruptions: kingship (best) → tyranny (worst); aristocracy → oligarchy; timocracy (property-based, weakest of the correct) → democracy (least bad corruption). Family analogues: father–son = kingship (or Persian tyranny); master–slave = tyranny; husband–wife = aristocracy (degrades to oligarchy if rule not by merit); brothers = timocracy; masterless/weak households resemble democracy.

- Friendship mirrors justice within regimes: most in kingship/parental relations (benefits flow down; honor and claims proportioned), equal-sharing among brothers/comrades/timocracies; little in corrupt forms, least in tyranny. No friendship/justice with tools or slaves as such; but insofar as slaves are human participants in law/contract, some minimal justice/friendship exists, greatest among corrupt forms in democracies due to equality.

- Kinship friendship roots in parent–child: parents love children as part of themselves (immediately, and mothers more); children love parents as their source (later, with understanding). Siblings love from shared origin (“same blood”).
