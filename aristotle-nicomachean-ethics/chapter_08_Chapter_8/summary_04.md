- Kinship friendships are asymmetric and rooted in origin. Parents love children as “a second self,” earlier and more intensely (they know the child first; what proceeds from us “belongs” to us), with mothers loving most; children love parents as their source, later, with understanding. Siblings love from common origin (“same blood”), strengthened by shared upbringing and age; their bond resembles comradeship. Other kinship ties vary in closeness with genealogical proximity. Children’s love for parents (like men’s for gods) targets a superior source of life, nurture, and education, yielding greater pleasure and benefit with greater shared life.

- Spousal friendship is natural: the household precedes the state; humans pair not only to procreate but to meet life’s needs via complementary roles. It mixes pleasure and utility and can be virtue-based if both are good. Children bind spouses; childless marriages dissolve more readily. Questions about how spouses/friends should live together are matters of justice appropriate to each relationship.

- In all three friendship types (virtue, pleasure, utility), there are equal and unequal cases: equals should love equally; unequals should render proportionate to merit.

- Quarrels chiefly afflict utility friendships. Virtue-friendships aim at benefitting each other and lack reproach; pleasure-friendships are voluntary, so complaint is silly.

- Utility friendships: two bases mirror written/unwritten justice.
  - Contractual: specified terms, either strict (cash) or deferred quid pro quo; fewer disputes if terms are clear.
  - Dispositional: gifts given “as a friend” later treated as loans, causing accusations. Since people prefer profit to the noble, clarify terms upfront. Repay if able; in utility, measure return by the recipient’s benefit; in virtue-friendships, by the benefactor’s purpose.

- Unequal friendships: both superior and needy have valid claims, but to different goods—honor to the virtuous/useful; material aid to the needy. Constitutions mirror this. Interpersonally, repay in the currency you can (honor or money). Friendship asks what is possible, not the impossible debts owed to gods and parents; sons can never fully repay, so may not disown fathers, though fathers could disown sons (rarely).
