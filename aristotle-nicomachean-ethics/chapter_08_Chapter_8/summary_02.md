- Only virtue-based friendship is secure: it resists slander, entails mutual trust and non-injury, and is “friendship simply.” Utility- and pleasure-based ties are “friendships” by resemblance (since they involve some good/pleasant), are contingent, and rarely coincide in the same pair.
- Friendship as activity vs disposition: when together, friends delight in and benefit each other; distance halts the exercise but not the disposition. Prolonged absence erodes friendship. Living together, shared pleasures, and liking the same things are characteristic; mere well-wishing without shared life is not full friendship.
- Friendship is a stable habit, not mere feeling. Love can target inanimate things, but friendship requires purpose and reciprocal wishing well for the other’s sake. In perfect friendship, benefits and love are equal; each loves his own good by loving a good friend.
- True friendships are few: they demand intensity, testing, and rarity of worthy partners. Pleasure-friendships resemble virtue-friendships more than utility ones. The happy seek pleasant companions for shared life, but ought also seek friends who are good and good for them.
- High-status people split friends into useful and pleasant; uniting both is rare. A good man is both pleasant and useful, but won’t befriend a superior unless he accepts inferiority in virtue to equalize the relation—something great men rarely do.
- Unequal friendships (parent–child, elder–younger, husband–wife, ruler–subject) differ by roles and excellences; reciprocity should be proportionate to desert, creating an equality suited to friendship. Extreme disparities (with gods, princes) preclude friendship.
- One should wish a friend the greatest goods compatible with his remaining human.
- Being loved is better than being honored; friendship lies more in loving. The virtue of a friend is to love proportionately to worth. Similarity in virtue stabilizes friendship and restrains wrongdoing; bad men’s friendships are fleeting and vice-based.
