<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Aristotle begins by noting that every action and inquiry aims at some good, and that ends form hierarchies: subordinate arts serve master-arts, whose ends are more choiceworthy (e.g., bridle-making serves horsemanship, which serves war). To avoid an infinite regress of ends, there must be a highest end desired for its own sake, the practical “good” at which we should aim. The science that orders all other pursuits toward this human good is Politics, which legislates actions and restraints for the sake of the common good, nobler than the individual’s.

Because ethical matters vary, we must be content with conclusions of the sort the subject permits, and the learner needs experience and a stable character. Methodologically, we start from endoxa—credible opinions—and from sound habituation, and we test our account against them. Nearly all agree the highest end is happiness (living/doing well), though they disagree about its nature. Wealth is merely instrumental; honor depends on others; virtue as mere possession can be inactive and coexist with misfortune; contemplation is deferred.

Aristotle rejects a single universal Good. “Good” applies across categories and does not yield one science; making it eternal doesn’t make it “more good.” Attempts to restrict the common form to intrinsic goods fail to produce a single definition; at best, goods are related by analogy. Even if such a universal existed, it would be useless for practice, since arts aim at concrete ends.

Returning to the human good, the function of a human is activity of soul in accordance with reason; thus happiness is sustained activity in accord with complete virtue over a complete life. This fits endoxa that goods of soul are best. Happiness lies in exercising virtue (like Olympic victors proving excellence), and virtuous activity is naturally pleasant, uniting the best, noblest, and pleasantest. External goods are still needed as instruments and conditions.

Happiness is stable yet humanly vulnerable: ordinary misfortunes do not undo it, though many great calamities diminish it; the fortunes of descendants affect the dead only slightly. Happiness is not praised but revered as a first principle. Since happiness is activity of soul, Politics must study the soul’s parts—the rational and the appetitive that can “listen to” reason—grounding intellectual and moral virtues.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- All action and inquiry aim at some good (end). Some ends are activities; others are products, and products are better than the activity when distinct. Ends form hierarchies: subordinate arts serve master-arts (e.g., bridle-making → horsemanship → war). The end of the master-art is more choiceworthy.
- To avoid infinite regress, there must be a highest end desired for its own sake; this is “the good,” practically crucial as a target for action.
- The master-science concerned with this highest human good is Politics: it orders other sciences, prescribes actions and restraints, and seeks the human good at a collective scale, which is nobler than the individual’s.
- Ethical-political inquiry admits only as much precision as the subject allows; we should be content with probable conclusions. Proper reception requires experience and stable character; youths or those ruled by feeling won’t benefit.
- Method: begin from what is known to us (endoxa) and from sound moral habituation, which supplies starting points.
- Nearly all agree the highest end is happiness (living/doing well), but disagree on its nature. Common candidates: pleasure, honor (linked to political life), contemplation, and wealth. Wealth is merely instrumental; honor depends on others; virtue alone seems incomplete (could be inactive and coexist with great misfortune). Contemplation is deferred for later treatment.
- Aristotle critiques a single “universal Good” (Platonic Form): “good” is predicated across categories (substance, quality, relation, time, place), lacks one science, and making it eternal doesn’t make it “more good.” He notes a more plausible Pythagorean alignment of “one” with good, and reports a Platonic reply limiting the common form to intrinsic goods (with instrumental goods called good derivatively).

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Further critique of a single, absolute Good: making the Good eternal doesn’t make it “more good.” A more plausible move is the Pythagorean association of the One with the good; Speusippus follows this. Platonists reply by restricting the common Form to intrinsic goods, distinguishing them from instrumental goods.
- Aristotle tests this: list intrinsic goods (e.g., wisdom, sight, certain pleasures, certain honors). If these don’t share one definable account of goodness, “good” isn’t univocal across them. In fact, each requires a different account; at best they may be related by common source/end or by analogy. Even if a universal Good existed, it’s not realizable and thus not the practical target. Arts don’t appeal to it; practitioners aim at concrete, particular ends.
- Return to the human good via ends: every art/action has an end; the final end is chosen only for itself. Happiness uniquely fits as strictly final and self-sufficient (considered socially, not solitarily), and is the most desirable thing not enhanced by additions.
- Function argument: human function is activity of soul in accordance with reason (both obeying and exercising reason). The human good is activity in accord with virtue—preferably the best and complete virtue—over a complete life.
- Method: sketch then fill in; demand only appropriate precision; starting points are undemonstrated (via induction, perception, training) and must be clarified; test against common opinions. Since goods of the soul are held to be best, identifying happiness with virtuous activities of soul fits endoxa.

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Test against common opinions (endoxa): Goods are external, of body, and of soul; goods of soul are primary. Since happiness is activity of soul, it aligns with this and with the saying “to live and do well.”
- Reconciling rival views: People cite virtue, prudence/wisdom, pleasure, and external prosperity. Each captures part of the truth.
  - Crucial distinction: happiness is not mere possession of virtue but its exercise; like Olympic victors, excellence must be manifested in action.
  - Virtuous activity is naturally pleasant; the good person delights in noble deeds. Thus the best, noblest, and pleasantest coincide in happiness, without needing added pleasure.
- External goods are still needed as instruments/conditions (friends, wealth, influence) and some circumstances (birth, children, beauty) affect the “bloom” of happiness.
- Source of happiness: even if divinely given, better and more fitting that it comes through learning/habituation/virtue; then it’s widely accessible. Politics rightly aims to form citizens of good character.
- Animals and children aren’t happy; a full life is required for sustained virtuous activity.
- Fortune and Solon’s dictum: Don’t tie happiness to fluctuating luck or to the state of the dead. Excellent activity is the most stable human thing; the happy person maintains virtuous conduct, bears misfortunes nobly, and isn’t easily deprived of happiness—though many great calamities can diminish it.
- Refined definition: happiness is sustained activity in accordance with perfect virtue, with sufficient external goods, over a complete life, continuing so and ending similarly.

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Stability of happiness amid fortune: The happy person, like a good craftsman using given materials well, won’t become miserable through ordinary misfortunes; only many great calamities can seriously impair happiness. Recovery, if it occurs, requires a long, complete period marked by noble achievements. Refined formula: happiness is sustained exercise of the faculties in accord with perfect virtue, with sufficient external goods, over a full term of years—and ideally continued to the end; such people are “blessed,” though only “happy as men.”

- Do friends’/descendants’ fortunes affect the dead? They may affect them slightly, but not enough to render the formerly happy unhappy (or the reverse). Effects are attenuated in the dead.

- Is happiness praised? Praise is relative to producing something; the highest things (gods, the best goods) are called blessed/revered, not praised. Thus happiness is a final, revered good and a principle/starting-point for action. Eudoxus used this schema to argue pleasure’s high status.

- Transition to virtue and the soul for political science: Happiness is activity of soul, so the statesman must know the soul. The soul has:
  - Irrational: nutritive (shared with plants; irrelevant to human excellence) and appetitive/desiderative, which can oppose but also “listen to” reason.
  - Rational: strictly rational vs that which obeys reason.
  This grounds two kinds of virtue: intellectual (wisdom, understanding, prudence) and moral (temperance, liberality), the latter defining character.
