- Stability of happiness amid fortune: The happy person, like a good craftsman using given materials well, won’t become miserable through ordinary misfortunes; only many great calamities can seriously impair happiness. Recovery, if it occurs, requires a long, complete period marked by noble achievements. Refined formula: happiness is sustained exercise of the faculties in accord with perfect virtue, with sufficient external goods, over a full term of years—and ideally continued to the end; such people are “blessed,” though only “happy as men.”

- Do friends’/descendants’ fortunes affect the dead? They may affect them slightly, but not enough to render the formerly happy unhappy (or the reverse). Effects are attenuated in the dead.

- Is happiness praised? Praise is relative to producing something; the highest things (gods, the best goods) are called blessed/revered, not praised. Thus happiness is a final, revered good and a principle/starting-point for action. Eudoxus used this schema to argue pleasure’s high status.

- Transition to virtue and the soul for political science: Happiness is activity of soul, so the statesman must know the soul. The soul has:
  - Irrational: nutritive (shared with plants; irrelevant to human excellence) and appetitive/desiderative, which can oppose but also “listen to” reason.
  - Rational: strictly rational vs that which obeys reason.
  This grounds two kinds of virtue: intellectual (wisdom, understanding, prudence) and moral (temperance, liberality), the latter defining character.
