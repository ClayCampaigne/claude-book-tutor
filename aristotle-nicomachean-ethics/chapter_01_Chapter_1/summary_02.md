- Further critique of a single, absolute Good: making the Good eternal doesn’t make it “more good.” A more plausible move is the Pythagorean association of the One with the good; Speusippus follows this. Platonists reply by restricting the common Form to intrinsic goods, distinguishing them from instrumental goods.
- Aristotle tests this: list intrinsic goods (e.g., wisdom, sight, certain pleasures, certain honors). If these don’t share one definable account of goodness, “good” isn’t univocal across them. In fact, each requires a different account; at best they may be related by common source/end or by analogy. Even if a universal Good existed, it’s not realizable and thus not the practical target. Arts don’t appeal to it; practitioners aim at concrete, particular ends.
- Return to the human good via ends: every art/action has an end; the final end is chosen only for itself. Happiness uniquely fits as strictly final and self-sufficient (considered socially, not solitarily), and is the most desirable thing not enhanced by additions.
- Function argument: human function is activity of soul in accordance with reason (both obeying and exercising reason). The human good is activity in accord with virtue—preferably the best and complete virtue—over a complete life.
- Method: sketch then fill in; demand only appropriate precision; starting points are undemonstrated (via induction, perception, training) and must be clarified; test against common opinions. Since goods of the soul are held to be best, identifying happiness with virtuous activities of soul fits endoxa.
