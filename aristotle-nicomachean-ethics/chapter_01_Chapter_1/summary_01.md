- All action and inquiry aim at some good (end). Some ends are activities; others are products, and products are better than the activity when distinct. Ends form hierarchies: subordinate arts serve master-arts (e.g., bridle-making → horsemanship → war). The end of the master-art is more choiceworthy.
- To avoid infinite regress, there must be a highest end desired for its own sake; this is “the good,” practically crucial as a target for action.
- The master-science concerned with this highest human good is Politics: it orders other sciences, prescribes actions and restraints, and seeks the human good at a collective scale, which is nobler than the individual’s.
- Ethical-political inquiry admits only as much precision as the subject allows; we should be content with probable conclusions. Proper reception requires experience and stable character; youths or those ruled by feeling won’t benefit.
- Method: begin from what is known to us (endoxa) and from sound moral habituation, which supplies starting points.
- Nearly all agree the highest end is happiness (living/doing well), but disagree on its nature. Common candidates: pleasure, honor (linked to political life), contemplation, and wealth. Wealth is merely instrumental; honor depends on others; virtue alone seems incomplete (could be inactive and coexist with great misfortune). Contemplation is deferred for later treatment.
- Aristotle critiques a single “universal Good” (Platonic Form): “good” is predicated across categories (substance, quality, relation, time, place), lacks one science, and making it eternal doesn’t make it “more good.” He notes a more plausible Pythagorean alignment of “one” with good, and reports a Platonic reply limiting the common form to intrinsic goods (with instrumental goods called good derivatively).
