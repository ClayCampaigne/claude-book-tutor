- Aim: Distinguish voluntary vs involuntary to ground praise/blame and legislation.
- Compulsion: An act is strictly involuntary when its cause is external and the agent contributes nothing (e.g., whirlwind). “Mixed” cases (e.g., obeying a tyrant to save family; jettisoning cargo in a storm) are chosen under present circumstances; since the moving cause is in the agent, they are voluntary now, though not choiceworthy in themselves. Such acts may be praised if for a noble end, blamed if for a trivial one, and sometimes pardoned if pressure exceeds human endurance; yet some deeds should be refused even at cost of death. No precise rules decide hard alternatives.
- Rejects labeling as “compulsory” actions done for pleasure or the noble, since that would make all acts compelled; compulsion is painful, while such acts are pleasant; blame lies in our yielding, not in externals.
- Ignorance: What is done through ignorance is “not-voluntary,” and “involuntary” only if followed by regret. Ignorance of universals (what ought to be done) is vice, not an excuse; ignorance of particulars (agent, act, object, instrument, end, manner), especially person affected and result, excuses—if accompanied by sorrow. Acting in ignorance due to drunkenness/anger does not qualify as “through ignorance.”
- Voluntary: originates in the agent with knowledge of particulars. Acts from anger/desire are voluntary; passions are as much ours as reason.
- Choice (prohairesis): more revealing of character than action; a subset of willing. It is not appetite, anger, wish, or opinion. We wish ends (even impossibles), but choose means within our power. Choice is willing after deliberation—a preference among alternatives—introducing the inquiry into what is fit for deliberation.
