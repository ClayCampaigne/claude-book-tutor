- Choice (prohairesis) is distinct from opinion: it concerns what is in our power, is praised/blamed for rightness, and follows deliberation. Definition: choice is deliberate desire for things in our power; we deliberate first, then desire accordingly.
- Deliberation’s scope: not about eternal/necessary facts, chance events, or matters beyond one’s agency; it targets action within our control, especially where rules hold “for the most part” and outcomes are uncertain. We deliberate about means, not ends; we analyze back through a chain of causes until the origin reaches ourselves, then act if the means are possible.
- Wish concerns ends. Resolution of dispute: the good simpliciter is the true object of wish, but to each person the wished-for is what seems good; the good person sees truly, whereas pleasure often distorts seeming-good.
- Since virtuous actions concern means, they proceed by choice and are voluntary; therefore virtue and vice are up to us. Law and practice confirm this via praise, punishment, and exceptions only for non-culpable compulsion/ignorance.
- Culpable ignorance (e.g., from drunkenness, negligence, ignorance of knowable laws) is punished. Repeated actions form character; thus one is responsible for becoming unjust/profligate, even if later unable to reverse easily (like a thrown stone or self-caused sickness).
- Bodily vices are blamed when self-caused. Objection that “appearance of the good” determines choice is answered: insofar as character is up to us, so is what seems good; denying this collapses responsibility into innate endowment.
