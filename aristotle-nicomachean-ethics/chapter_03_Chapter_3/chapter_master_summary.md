<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Aristotle seeks to ground praise, blame, and legislation by distinguishing the voluntary from the involuntary and by clarifying choice and deliberation. Strictly involuntary acts have external causes to which the agent contributes nothing (a whirlwind). “Mixed” acts, such as obeying a tyrant to save one’s family or jettisoning cargo in a storm, are chosen under present circumstances; since their moving cause is in the agent, they are voluntary now, though not choiceworthy in themselves. They may be praised when done for a noble end, blamed for a trivial one, and sometimes pardoned when pressures exceed human endurance—yet some deeds must be refused even at the cost of death. Actions done “for pleasure or the noble” are not compulsory; compulsion is painful, and blame lies in yielding, not in externals.

What is done through ignorance is “not-voluntary,” and “involuntary” only if followed by regret. Ignorance of universals is vice, not excuse; ignorance of particulars (agent, act, object, instrument, end, manner)—especially person affected and result—excuses if accompanied by sorrow. Acting in ignorance from drunkenness or anger does not qualify.

The voluntary originates in the agent with knowledge of particulars. Acts from anger and desire are voluntary; passions are as much ours as reason. Choice (prohairesis), more revealing of character than action, is willing after deliberation: deliberate desire of what is in our power. We wish ends (even impossibles) but deliberate about means under our control, in domains where outcomes are uncertain and rules hold “for the most part.” The good simpliciter is the proper object of wish, but things seem good as character disposes; the virtuous see truly. Since virtuous action concerns means, virtue and vice are up to us; law rightly praises, punishes, and excuses only for non-culpable compulsion or ignorance. Culpable ignorance (negligence, drunkenness) is punished. Habits grow from earlier voluntary acts; hence character, and what seems good, are also up to us.

Turning to virtues: courage is the mean concerning fear and confidence, chiefly about death in noble contexts (war). True courage endures pain for the noble; it differs from foolhardiness and cowardice, and from look-alikes grounded in honor, expertise, rage, optimism, or ignorance. Temperance moderates bodily pleasures of touch (food, drink, sex). The temperate person, guided by right reason, desires what, as, and when he ought; profligacy, more voluntary and blameworthy than cowardice, indulges base pleasures and must be chastened like a child by reason.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Aim: Distinguish voluntary vs involuntary to ground praise/blame and legislation.
- Compulsion: An act is strictly involuntary when its cause is external and the agent contributes nothing (e.g., whirlwind). “Mixed” cases (e.g., obeying a tyrant to save family; jettisoning cargo in a storm) are chosen under present circumstances; since the moving cause is in the agent, they are voluntary now, though not choiceworthy in themselves. Such acts may be praised if for a noble end, blamed if for a trivial one, and sometimes pardoned if pressure exceeds human endurance; yet some deeds should be refused even at cost of death. No precise rules decide hard alternatives.
- Rejects labeling as “compulsory” actions done for pleasure or the noble, since that would make all acts compelled; compulsion is painful, while such acts are pleasant; blame lies in our yielding, not in externals.
- Ignorance: What is done through ignorance is “not-voluntary,” and “involuntary” only if followed by regret. Ignorance of universals (what ought to be done) is vice, not an excuse; ignorance of particulars (agent, act, object, instrument, end, manner), especially person affected and result, excuses—if accompanied by sorrow. Acting in ignorance due to drunkenness/anger does not qualify as “through ignorance.”
- Voluntary: originates in the agent with knowledge of particulars. Acts from anger/desire are voluntary; passions are as much ours as reason.
- Choice (prohairesis): more revealing of character than action; a subset of willing. It is not appetite, anger, wish, or opinion. We wish ends (even impossibles), but choose means within our power. Choice is willing after deliberation—a preference among alternatives—introducing the inquiry into what is fit for deliberation.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Choice (prohairesis) is distinct from opinion: it concerns what is in our power, is praised/blamed for rightness, and follows deliberation. Definition: choice is deliberate desire for things in our power; we deliberate first, then desire accordingly.
- Deliberation’s scope: not about eternal/necessary facts, chance events, or matters beyond one’s agency; it targets action within our control, especially where rules hold “for the most part” and outcomes are uncertain. We deliberate about means, not ends; we analyze back through a chain of causes until the origin reaches ourselves, then act if the means are possible.
- Wish concerns ends. Resolution of dispute: the good simpliciter is the true object of wish, but to each person the wished-for is what seems good; the good person sees truly, whereas pleasure often distorts seeming-good.
- Since virtuous actions concern means, they proceed by choice and are voluntary; therefore virtue and vice are up to us. Law and practice confirm this via praise, punishment, and exceptions only for non-culpable compulsion/ignorance.
- Culpable ignorance (e.g., from drunkenness, negligence, ignorance of knowable laws) is punished. Repeated actions form character; thus one is responsible for becoming unjust/profligate, even if later unable to reverse easily (like a thrown stone or self-caused sickness).
- Bodily vices are blamed when self-caused. Objection that “appearance of the good” determines choice is answered: insofar as character is up to us, so is what seems good; denying this collapses responsibility into innate endowment.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Objection addressed: if “the end” appears as good due to character and we can’t control that appearance, are we responsible? Aristotle replies: since we are in some measure responsible for forming our character, we are likewise responsible for what seems good to us. Otherwise vice would be mere ignorance of ends and virtue no more voluntary than vice. But because both ends-seeming and the selection of means involve the self, vice is as voluntary as virtue.

- Voluntariness of habits vs acts: particular actions are within our control “from beginning to end” when we know particulars. Habits/character grow imperceptibly (like disease), but their origins lie in earlier voluntary uses of our powers; thus character is voluntary.

- Transition: virtues are means per right reason; he now treats them individually, beginning with courage.

- Courage: mean concerning fear and confidence, aimed at the noble. Proper arena: greatest terrors, especially honorable death in war, where prowess and noble death are possible. Not about all fears (e.g., poverty/disease) nor seeking death to escape pain.

- Traits around courage:
  - Excess: foolhardiness (overconfidence, often boastful; collapses in real danger); total fearlessness is inhuman.
  - Defect: cowardice (excess fear, despondency). The courageous are calm before danger, resolute in it.

- Five look-alikes:
  1) Political/shame-honor courage: facing danger for honor/reproach; closest to true courage; inferior when compelled by fear of punishment.
  2) Experience-based courage: professionals seem brave from skill/equipment and realistic appraisal; flee when odds worsen—prefer safety over honor.
  3) Rage-based courage: rushing from anger/pain resembles courage; true courage uses rage as aid but acts for the noble by reason (contrast with beasts moved by pain).
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Completes “look-alikes” of courage and clarifies true courage:
  - Experienced professionals seem brave but flee when outmatched; citizen-soldiers stand from shame/honor—true courage values noble action over life.
  - Rage-driven boldness resembles courage but is passion-led (like beasts or lustful adulterers); only when governed by reason for the sake of the noble does spiritedness aid real courage.
  - Sanguine/optimistic confidence (often from past victories or drunkenness) collapses when expectations fail; true courage faces known terrors because it is noble.
  - Unaware fighters appear brave but run when they discover the real danger.
- Courage chiefly concerns fear (enduring pains) rather than confidence. Its end is pleasant (noble honor) but obscured by present pains (death, wounds), like athletes enduring blows for a crown. The better and happier a person, the more painful death is—thus their courage is greater for choosing the noble despite greater loss. Reckless men may fight more “efficiently,” but are not more courageous.
- Transition to temperance: the other virtue of the nonrational part.
  - Temperance concerns bodily pleasures, especially of touch in eating, drinking, and sex (taste only as discrimination); not pleasures of sight, hearing, smells per se, nor intellectual/social pleasures.
  - Profligacy is most censured as animal-like, fixing love on such pleasures; excludes “manly” bodily comforts (e.g., baths) taken over the whole body.
  - Desires: natural/common (basic hunger, thirst, sex) vs individual/acquired (particular objects/modes). Excess in the latter defines profligacy: delighting in wrong things, too intensely, or in the wrong way/time; marked by pain at deprivation (since appetite involves pain).
  - Insensibility (deficiency) is rare/nonhuman. The temperate person: disdains base pleasures, is not pained by their absence, desires moderately what is healthy, not injurious, not ignoble, and within means, guided by right reason.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Insensibility to bodily pleasures is virtually nonhuman: even animals discriminate pleasures; a person to whom nothing is pleasant does not exist.
- The temperate person hits the mean: he disdains the intense, base pleasures favored by the profligate; takes little or no pleasure in the wrong things; is not pained by their absence; and desires moderately what is pleasant when it also promotes health and good condition. He accepts other pleasures only if they are neither harmful, ignoble, nor beyond his means, being guided by right reason.
- Profligacy is more voluntary and blameworthy than cowardice:
  - It is driven by pleasure (which we choose), whereas cowardice is driven by pain (which disturbs and is avoided).
  - Training against profligacy is easier and safer, since such occasions are frequent; occasions of fear are rarer and risky.
  - Cowardice as a habit is more voluntary than its particular acts, which momentary fear makes quasi-compulsory; conversely, profligate acts are voluntary though no one wishes the profligate character.
- Profligacy resembles childishness: appetite is expansive and, if unchecked, grows through gratification, even expelling reason. Therefore gratifications should be few and moderate; appetite must be “chastened,” subordinated to reason like a child to a tutor.
- Temperance finalized: appetites harmonize with reason; the temperate person desires what, as, and when he ought, for the sake of the noble.
