- Objection addressed: if “the end” appears as good due to character and we can’t control that appearance, are we responsible? Aristotle replies: since we are in some measure responsible for forming our character, we are likewise responsible for what seems good to us. Otherwise vice would be mere ignorance of ends and virtue no more voluntary than vice. But because both ends-seeming and the selection of means involve the self, vice is as voluntary as virtue.

- Voluntariness of habits vs acts: particular actions are within our control “from beginning to end” when we know particulars. Habits/character grow imperceptibly (like disease), but their origins lie in earlier voluntary uses of our powers; thus character is voluntary.

- Transition: virtues are means per right reason; he now treats them individually, beginning with courage.

- Courage: mean concerning fear and confidence, aimed at the noble. Proper arena: greatest terrors, especially honorable death in war, where prowess and noble death are possible. Not about all fears (e.g., poverty/disease) nor seeking death to escape pain.

- Traits around courage:
  - Excess: foolhardiness (overconfidence, often boastful; collapses in real danger); total fearlessness is inhuman.
  - Defect: cowardice (excess fear, despondency). The courageous are calm before danger, resolute in it.

- Five look-alikes:
  1) Political/shame-honor courage: facing danger for honor/reproach; closest to true courage; inferior when compelled by fear of punishment.
  2) Experience-based courage: professionals seem brave from skill/equipment and realistic appraisal; flee when odds worsen—prefer safety over honor.
  3) Rage-based courage: rushing from anger/pain resembles courage; true courage uses rage as aid but acts for the noble by reason (contrast with beasts moved by pain).
