<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter clarifies the “right reason” that fixes the mean by specifying the rational states that set practical standards. The rational soul has two parts: a scientific faculty that knows what is necessary and invariable, and a calculative/deliberative faculty that deals with contingent matters open to choice. Action does not arise from sense but from the union of reason and desire. Choice is desire shaped by deliberation; correct choice requires both true calculation and right desire aiming at the same end. Hence practical truth is truth in agreement with right desire. Purpose is the efficient cause of action, formed by desire plus reasoning about means, and concerns the future. Action (praxis) is an end in itself; production (poiesis) aims at an external product.

Five stable states attain truth: science (episteme), art (techne), prudence (phronesis), wisdom (sophia), and reason/intuitive intellect (nous). Science demonstrates necessary truths from first principles; those principles are grasped by nous, not by science. Art is a capacity to make, guided by correct calculation about contingent products; it concerns production, not action. Prudence is the deliberative grasp of practical truth that issues in right action about human good; because its objects are variable, it is neither science nor art, and voluntary error in it is blameworthy. Temperance safeguards prudential judgment by protecting the ends from pleasure and pain. Wisdom unites nous and science about the highest, invariable objects; it is theoretical and distinct from prudence.

Prudence requires universals and, crucially, experience of particulars, since action concerns particulars; thus the young can learn mathematics but are not prudent. It spans personal conduct, household management, and politics, whose highest form is legislation; narrower statesmanship issues decrees and includes deliberative and judicial functions. Allied capacities include good deliberation (euboulia), sound understanding (synesis), and equitable judgment (gnome); prudence commands, while nous grasps both first principles and the “ultimate particulars” that terminate practical reasoning.

Wisdom and prudence are desirable in themselves and jointly necessary for perfect action: moral virtue makes the end right, prudence the means. Cleverness, the power to achieve any set end, is needed for prudence but is morally indeterminate; without virtue it serves base aims. Natural virtue matures into full virtue only under prudence. Thus prudence and moral virtue entail one another, and prudence serves, rather than rules, wisdom’s higher ends.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Aim: Clarify “right reason” that determines the mean. Merely saying “as right reason orders” is too vague; we must specify the rational states that deliver practical standards.

- Division of rational soul: two faculties correspond to two kinds of objects:
  - Scientific/demonstrative (knows necessary, invariable things).
  - Calculative/deliberative (knows variable, contingent things; the domain of deliberation).

- Action’s psychology: Sense does not originate action; action arises from reason and desire. Choice (prohairesis) = desire following deliberation. Correct choice requires both true calculation and right desire aiming at the same end. Practical intellect’s truth is “truth in agreement with right desire.”

- Purpose is the efficient cause of action, arising from desire plus reasoning about means; it concerns the future (not the past). Practical reasoning also guides production, but:
  - Action (praxis) is an end in itself (well-doing).
  - Production (poiesis) aims at an external product.

- Five truth-attaining states: art (techne), science (episteme), prudence (phronesis), wisdom (sophia), and reason/intellect (nous).
  - Science: demonstrative knowledge of necessary/eternal truths, proceeding from first principles grasped by induction to syllogistic conclusions; principles must be better known than conclusions.
  - Art: hexis of producing with correct calculation about contingent items whose cause lies in the maker; opposed to lack-of-art (incorrect calculation); concerns production, not action.
  - Prudence: hexis that apprehends practical truth through deliberation and issues in right action about human good (household/statecraft exemplify it). Not science (objects are variable) nor art (not production). Voluntary error is worse in prudence (as with virtues). Temperance preserves prudential judgment by shielding practical principles (ends) from corruption by pleasure/pain.
  - First principles of demonstrative knowledge are grasped by reason (nous), not by science, art, prudence, or wisdom.
  - Wisdom begins as “mastery” in crafts; fuller account to follow.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Principles of demonstration are not grasped by science, art, prudence, or wisdom; they are apprehended by reason (nous), the error-free faculty for first principles.

- Wisdom (sophia) = union of reason (nous) with scientific knowledge (episteme) about the noblest, invariable objects. It is theoretical and not the same as prudence or statecraft. Hence thinkers like Thales are “wise” but not “prudent,” since their knowledge doesn’t secure human goods.

- Prudence (phronesis) concerns human affairs that admit deliberation; it requires both universals and, especially, particulars, because action is about particulars. Experience is therefore essential; the young can learn math but cannot be prudent.

- Prudence and statesmanship are one faculty manifested at different levels:
  - Supreme practical form: legislative science.
  - Narrower “statesmanship”: action-focused issuance of decrees (last step toward action), subdivided into deliberative and judicial.
  - Also includes household management and care of one’s own affairs. True management of one’s own good likely depends on competence in household and civic management.

- Prudence targets “ultimate particulars,” grasped by a practical perceptual capacity analogous to recognizing a triangle in math; this is a kind of “sense,” distinct from both science and intuitive reason about first principles.

- Good deliberation (euboulia) is correctness of reasoning in deliberation that reaches what is good/expendient by the right grounds, in the right way, at the right time; it is neither science, opinion, nor mere quick-witted guessing.

- Intelligence/sound understanding (synesis) discerns fitly in deliberable matters using received opinions; it does not command like prudence.

- Judgment (gnome) is correct discernment of the equitable. Prudence, intelligence, judgment, and reason are commonly ascribed together and converge on discerning particulars in practical matters.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Judgment (gnome) = correct discernment of the equitable; “kindly judgment” is true judgment of what equity requires. Along with intelligence/sound understanding (synesis), prudence (phronesis), and intuitive reason (nous), these converge on “ultimate particulars” in action.
- Scope of faculties:
  - Prudence commands what to do; intelligence/sound understanding judges fittingly in deliberable matters; judgment discerns the equitable; intuitive reason grasps ultimates in two senses:
    - First principles (starting points of moral-political reasoning).
    - Particular minor premises in practical syllogisms (the here-and-now fact that determines what to do).
  - Universals are elicited from particulars; perception-like nous supplies both first principles and the “ultimate particular.” These capacities are natural and grow with age/experience, whose undemonstrated opinions merit respect.

- Use and value:
  - Wisdom (sophia) and prudence are desirable in themselves; they also “produce”:
    - Wisdom makes one happy by its possession/exercise as a part of complete virtue.
    - Perfect action needs both: moral virtue makes the end right; prudence makes the means right.

- Cleverness (deinotes) is the capacity to attain whatever end; it is necessary for prudence but morally ambivalent. Without moral virtue, cleverness serves base ends. Vice corrupts the starting-points of practical reasoning; hence one cannot be prudent without being morally good.

- Natural vs full virtue: innate tendencies (in children/animals) are “natural virtues” that, unguided by reason, can harm; informed by prudence they become full virtue. Thus:
  - Moral virtues imply right reason (prudence), rather than being kinds of knowledge.
  - Full virtue and prudence are mutually entailing; prudence’s presence implies the moral virtues’ unity.
  - Prudence does not rule wisdom; it furnishes means in service of reason’s higher ends.
