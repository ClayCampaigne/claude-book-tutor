- Aim: Clarify “right reason” that determines the mean. Merely saying “as right reason orders” is too vague; we must specify the rational states that deliver practical standards.

- Division of rational soul: two faculties correspond to two kinds of objects:
  - Scientific/demonstrative (knows necessary, invariable things).
  - Calculative/deliberative (knows variable, contingent things; the domain of deliberation).

- Action’s psychology: Sense does not originate action; action arises from reason and desire. Choice (prohairesis) = desire following deliberation. Correct choice requires both true calculation and right desire aiming at the same end. Practical intellect’s truth is “truth in agreement with right desire.”

- Purpose is the efficient cause of action, arising from desire plus reasoning about means; it concerns the future (not the past). Practical reasoning also guides production, but:
  - Action (praxis) is an end in itself (well-doing).
  - Production (poiesis) aims at an external product.

- Five truth-attaining states: art (techne), science (episteme), prudence (phronesis), wisdom (sophia), and reason/intellect (nous).
  - Science: demonstrative knowledge of necessary/eternal truths, proceeding from first principles grasped by induction to syllogistic conclusions; principles must be better known than conclusions.
  - Art: hexis of producing with correct calculation about contingent items whose cause lies in the maker; opposed to lack-of-art (incorrect calculation); concerns production, not action.
  - Prudence: hexis that apprehends practical truth through deliberation and issues in right action about human good (household/statecraft exemplify it). Not science (objects are variable) nor art (not production). Voluntary error is worse in prudence (as with virtues). Temperance preserves prudential judgment by shielding practical principles (ends) from corruption by pleasure/pain.
  - First principles of demonstrative knowledge are grasped by reason (nous), not by science, art, prudence, or wisdom.
  - Wisdom begins as “mastery” in crafts; fuller account to follow.
