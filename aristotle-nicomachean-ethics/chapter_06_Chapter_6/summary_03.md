- Judgment (gnome) = correct discernment of the equitable; “kindly judgment” is true judgment of what equity requires. Along with intelligence/sound understanding (synesis), prudence (phronesis), and intuitive reason (nous), these converge on “ultimate particulars” in action.
- Scope of faculties:
  - Prudence commands what to do; intelligence/sound understanding judges fittingly in deliberable matters; judgment discerns the equitable; intuitive reason grasps ultimates in two senses:
    - First principles (starting points of moral-political reasoning).
    - Particular minor premises in practical syllogisms (the here-and-now fact that determines what to do).
  - Universals are elicited from particulars; perception-like nous supplies both first principles and the “ultimate particular.” These capacities are natural and grow with age/experience, whose undemonstrated opinions merit respect.

- Use and value:
  - Wisdom (sophia) and prudence are desirable in themselves; they also “produce”:
    - Wisdom makes one happy by its possession/exercise as a part of complete virtue.
    - Perfect action needs both: moral virtue makes the end right; prudence makes the means right.

- Cleverness (deinotes) is the capacity to attain whatever end; it is necessary for prudence but morally ambivalent. Without moral virtue, cleverness serves base ends. Vice corrupts the starting-points of practical reasoning; hence one cannot be prudent without being morally good.

- Natural vs full virtue: innate tendencies (in children/animals) are “natural virtues” that, unguided by reason, can harm; informed by prudence they become full virtue. Thus:
  - Moral virtues imply right reason (prudence), rather than being kinds of knowledge.
  - Full virtue and prudence are mutually entailing; prudence’s presence implies the moral virtues’ unity.
  - Prudence does not rule wisdom; it furnishes means in service of reason’s higher ends.
