- Principles of demonstration are not grasped by science, art, prudence, or wisdom; they are apprehended by reason (nous), the error-free faculty for first principles.

- Wisdom (sophia) = union of reason (nous) with scientific knowledge (episteme) about the noblest, invariable objects. It is theoretical and not the same as prudence or statecraft. Hence thinkers like Thales are “wise” but not “prudent,” since their knowledge doesn’t secure human goods.

- Prudence (phronesis) concerns human affairs that admit deliberation; it requires both universals and, especially, particulars, because action is about particulars. Experience is therefore essential; the young can learn math but cannot be prudent.

- Prudence and statesmanship are one faculty manifested at different levels:
  - Supreme practical form: legislative science.
  - Narrower “statesmanship”: action-focused issuance of decrees (last step toward action), subdivided into deliberative and judicial.
  - Also includes household management and care of one’s own affairs. True management of one’s own good likely depends on competence in household and civic management.

- Prudence targets “ultimate particulars,” grasped by a practical perceptual capacity analogous to recognizing a triangle in math; this is a kind of “sense,” distinct from both science and intuitive reason about first principles.

- Good deliberation (euboulia) is correctness of reasoning in deliberation that reaches what is good/expendient by the right grounds, in the right way, at the right time; it is neither science, opinion, nor mere quick-witted guessing.

- Intelligence/sound understanding (synesis) discerns fitly in deliberable matters using received opinions; it does not command like prudence.

- Judgment (gnome) is correct discernment of the equitable. Prudence, intelligence, judgment, and reason are commonly ascribed together and converge on discerning particulars in practical matters.
