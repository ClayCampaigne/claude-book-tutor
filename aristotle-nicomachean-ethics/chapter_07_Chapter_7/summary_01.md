- Aristotle distinguishes three undesirable states: vice, incontinence (akrasia), and brutality. Opposites: virtue vs vice; continence vs incontinence; the contrary of brutality is a “godlike” excellence beyond human virtue. Brutality is rare, seen among “barbarians,” disease, or as hyperbolic blame.

- Scope and method: He will treat incontinence/continence and softness/hardiness as states neither identical with virtue/vice nor wholly different. He begins from common opinions and resolves puzzles.

- Common opinions (endoxa): 
  1) Continence and hardiness are laudable; incontinence and softness blameworthy.
  2) Continence = sticking to one’s rational calculation; incontinence = swerving from it.
  3) The incontinent acts against known badness under passion; the continent restrains bad desires by reason.
  4) Temperance is continent and hardy; debate whether the converse holds; some equate profligacy with incontinence, others distinguish.
  5) Some deny the prudent can be incontinent; others say prudent/clever men are.
  6) People are called incontinent about anger, honor, gain.

- Aporiai:
  • Against Socrates’ denial of akrasia: experience shows people act against their better judgment; if ignorance is involved, it is of a special sort.
  • It’s not merely weak “opinion” opposing desire; we still blame the incontinent. Nor can prudence be the opposing state, since the prudent cannot do vile acts.
  • Continence can’t require strong bad desires in the temperate; thus continence and temperance differ: the profligate pursues present pleasure by choice; the incontinent believes he shouldn’t yet pursues.
  • If continence meant sticking to any opinion it could be bad; some incontinence (abandoning a false plan, e.g., Neoptolemus) seems praiseworthy. Sophistic puzzles (folly + incontinence ⇒ “virtue”) are flagged.

- Field: the “simply” incontinent is about the same objects as profligacy (bodily pleasures), but differs in manner (acting against one’s better view), not merely in domain.

- How akrasia is possible: 
  • Distinguish “having” vs “using” knowledge; one may have universal knowledge dormant while lacking the operative particular premise. Action turns on the particular (the thing here-and-now).
  • Passions render knowledge inoperative (like sleep, drunkenness); parroting truths isn’t full knowing.
  • Practical syllogism: when a hedonic universal (“all sweet is pleasant”) combines with the perceived particular (“this is sweet”) and appetite is present, it propels action, overriding a contrary forbidding universal, because the effective premise is the particular joined to appetite.
