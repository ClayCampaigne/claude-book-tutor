- Continence stands between deficiency (rare insensibility to bodily pleasures) and excess (incontinence). We often call the temperate “continent” metaphorically: both never act against reason for bodily pleasure, but the continent still has bad desires and resists them; the temperate lacks such desires. Profligates and incontinents both chase bodily pleasures, but the profligate does so by choice/principle, the incontinent against his better judgment.

- Prudence and incontinence are incompatible. People mistake cleverness for prudence; a clever person can be incontinent, but the prudent cannot. The incontinent’s knowledge is inoperative (as if asleep/drunk). His acts are voluntary yet “half-bad”: he intends the good but fails in execution; he is not unjust (no settled malice). Analogy: good laws never enforced vs bad laws enforced. Incontinence from melancholic impulsivity is more curable than resolution-breaking; habit-based incontinence is easier to reform than one rooted in nature; habit becomes “second nature.”

- Turn to pleasure: survey of views—(1) no pleasure good; (2) some good, most bad; (3) all good but none is the highest. Aristotle’s replies: pleasure is not a mere process to restoration but an unimpeded activity of a natural state; some “pleasures” are only medicinal reliefs. Proper pleasures enhance, not impede, their own activities; other pleasures impede. Lack of an “art of pleasure” is no objection. Temperate/prudent avoid excess and the pains tied to appetitive pleasures but have fitting pleasures.

- Since pain is bad, its opposite as such is good; some pleasure may be the highest good because happiness is unimpeded activity (pleasure) and needs external goods to avoid impediments; the “happy on the rack” thesis is false. Universal pursuit of pleasure hints at a single true pleasure aligned with the divine element, though people mistake bodily pleasures (common/accessible) for pleasure simply. Bodily goods admit excess; vice lies in pursuing excess, not necessary pleasures.
