- Appetite-based incontinence is worse than anger-based: anger is more “natural,” partly heeds reason, is open rather than crafty, and is painful in act; appetite ignores reason, seeks unnecessary/excessive pleasures, acts with guile and for pleasure, hence is more unjust and disgraceful. “Incontinence simply” concerns bodily pleasures of touch/taste.

- Scope of temperance/profligacy: they concern human, natural pleasures in kind/degree; bestial/brutal perversions (from nature, disease, or injury) lie outside. Brutality lacks reason’s principle—less dangerous but more horrible than vice; vice (with reason corrupted) can do greater harm.

- Character map in bodily matters:
  • Profligate: pursues excessive/illegitimate pleasures by deliberate choice, without remorse; incurable and worse than the incontinent.  
  • Incontinent: knows the right but fails under passion; feels remorse; curable; “like vice” only in a way. Two types: hasty (no deliberation; quick or intense impressions) and weak (deliberates but doesn’t abide).  
  • Continent vs hardy: continence overcomes allurements; hardiness endures pains. Continence is better than hardiness.  
  • Softness: yields to pains/pleasures most people resist (often linked to luxury); contrasted with hardness.

- Practical principles: Virtue (natural or trained) preserves the practical “principle” (right end); vice destroys it. Hence the profligate believes bad pleasures are good; the incontinent does not, so can improve.

- Continence concerns adherence to true/right reason “essentially,” not just any opinion. Distinguish stubbornness/obstinacy (resists reason, resembles incontinence) from true continence.

- Not all resolution-changes are incontinent: abandoning for a noble pleasure (truth, as with Neoptolemus) is not base. Deficiency in bodily pleasure is rare; thus incontinence is treated as continence’s main opposite. Temperate differs from continent: the temperate has no bad desires; the continent has them but is not swayed.
