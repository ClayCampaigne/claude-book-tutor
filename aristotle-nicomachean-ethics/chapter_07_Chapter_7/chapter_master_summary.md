<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Aristotle opens by distinguishing three undesirable states: vice, incontinence (akrasia), and brutality. Virtue is opposed to vice, continence to incontinence, while the contrary of brutality is a “godlike” excellence beyond human virtue. Treating continence/incontinence and softness/hardiness as states related to but distinct from virtue and vice, he proceeds from reputable opinions and resolves puzzles.

Common views hold continence and hardiness praiseworthy, incontinence and softness blameworthy; the continent stick to rational calculation, the incontinent swerve from it; temperance seems allied with continence, though they are not identical; some conflate profligacy with incontinence; and people are called incontinent not only about bodily pleasures but also anger, honor, or gain. Against Socrates’ denial of akrasia, Aristotle argues experience shows people act against better judgment. The resolution lies in practical cognition: we can “have” knowledge without “using” it. In action the particular premise governs; passion can render the universal inert, as in sleep or drunkenness. When a universal forbidding pleasure conflicts with “all sweet is pleasant,” perception of “this is sweet,” joined with appetite, moves to action. Thus desire, not opinion, opposes right reason; brutes, lacking universals, are not incontinent.

“Simple” incontinence concerns the same bodily pleasures as temperance and profligacy (food, drink, sex, heat/cold); incontinence about anger is less disgraceful because anger partly heeds reason. The profligate pursues excessive pleasures by choice and is worse and harder to cure; the incontinent knows the right yet fails under passion, feels remorse, and is reformable. Temperance differs from continence: the temperate has no bad desires, the continent resists them. Softness yields where most endure; continence is better than mere hardiness. Prudence is incompatible with incontinence; cleverness is not prudence. Acts of the incontinent are voluntary yet “half-bad,” lacking settled injustice.

Turning to pleasure, Aristotle rejects views that deny its goodness. Proper pleasure is the unimpeded activity of a natural state; “remedial” pleasures are only accidentally good. Since pain is bad, some pleasures are good, and happiness is unimpeded activity. Bodily pleasures seem preeminent because they relieve antecedent pains and are accessible, but vice lies in pursuing excess. Human pleasure cannot be continuous; a divine, simple activity would be truer pleasure. Having treated continence, incontinence, and pleasure, Aristotle turns next to friendship.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Aristotle distinguishes three undesirable states: vice, incontinence (akrasia), and brutality. Opposites: virtue vs vice; continence vs incontinence; the contrary of brutality is a “godlike” excellence beyond human virtue. Brutality is rare, seen among “barbarians,” disease, or as hyperbolic blame.

- Scope and method: He will treat incontinence/continence and softness/hardiness as states neither identical with virtue/vice nor wholly different. He begins from common opinions and resolves puzzles.

- Common opinions (endoxa): 
  1) Continence and hardiness are laudable; incontinence and softness blameworthy.
  2) Continence = sticking to one’s rational calculation; incontinence = swerving from it.
  3) The incontinent acts against known badness under passion; the continent restrains bad desires by reason.
  4) Temperance is continent and hardy; debate whether the converse holds; some equate profligacy with incontinence, others distinguish.
  5) Some deny the prudent can be incontinent; others say prudent/clever men are.
  6) People are called incontinent about anger, honor, gain.

- Aporiai:
  • Against Socrates’ denial of akrasia: experience shows people act against their better judgment; if ignorance is involved, it is of a special sort.
  • It’s not merely weak “opinion” opposing desire; we still blame the incontinent. Nor can prudence be the opposing state, since the prudent cannot do vile acts.
  • Continence can’t require strong bad desires in the temperate; thus continence and temperance differ: the profligate pursues present pleasure by choice; the incontinent believes he shouldn’t yet pursues.
  • If continence meant sticking to any opinion it could be bad; some incontinence (abandoning a false plan, e.g., Neoptolemus) seems praiseworthy. Sophistic puzzles (folly + incontinence ⇒ “virtue”) are flagged.

- Field: the “simply” incontinent is about the same objects as profligacy (bodily pleasures), but differs in manner (acting against one’s better view), not merely in domain.

- How akrasia is possible: 
  • Distinguish “having” vs “using” knowledge; one may have universal knowledge dormant while lacking the operative particular premise. Action turns on the particular (the thing here-and-now).
  • Passions render knowledge inoperative (like sleep, drunkenness); parroting truths isn’t full knowing.
  • Practical syllogism: when a hedonic universal (“all sweet is pleasant”) combines with the perceived particular (“this is sweet”) and appetite is present, it propels action, overriding a contrary forbidding universal, because the effective premise is the particular joined to appetite.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Cause of akrasia via practical syllogism: action follows the particular premise. When two universals conflict—one forbidding, one asserting “all sweet is pleasant”—the perceptual minor premise “this is sweet,” joined with appetite, moves the body. Thus akrasia occurs “under” opinion only accidentally; desire, not opinion, opposes right reason. Brutes lack universals, so cannot be incontinent. Under passion the agent “has” only a degraded, perceptual/minor cognition (like a drunk reciting), which vindicates Socrates in a limited way: strict knowledge is not operative at the moment.

- Scope of simple incontinence: it concerns bodily pleasures of touch and taste tied to necessity (food, drink, sex, heat/cold), the same field as temperance/profligacy. Excess about honor, wealth, victory, etc., yields only qualified “incontinence” by resemblance; likewise “softness” applies only in bodily matters. Profligates choose excess; the incontinent act against their choice.

- Brutal and morbid cases: some perverse pleasures stem from bad nature, disease, or habituation; these fall outside strict vice/akrasia. We speak only metaphorically of continence/incontinence here; “human” vice/akrasia aligns with profligacy’s domain.

- Anger vs appetite: incontinence in anger is less disgraceful. Anger half-heeds reason (to avenge a perceived slight) and is more natural; appetite ignores reason and is crafty. Hence appetite-based akrasia is more unjust and is akrasia “simply.”
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Appetite-based incontinence is worse than anger-based: anger is more “natural,” partly heeds reason, is open rather than crafty, and is painful in act; appetite ignores reason, seeks unnecessary/excessive pleasures, acts with guile and for pleasure, hence is more unjust and disgraceful. “Incontinence simply” concerns bodily pleasures of touch/taste.

- Scope of temperance/profligacy: they concern human, natural pleasures in kind/degree; bestial/brutal perversions (from nature, disease, or injury) lie outside. Brutality lacks reason’s principle—less dangerous but more horrible than vice; vice (with reason corrupted) can do greater harm.

- Character map in bodily matters:
  • Profligate: pursues excessive/illegitimate pleasures by deliberate choice, without remorse; incurable and worse than the incontinent.  
  • Incontinent: knows the right but fails under passion; feels remorse; curable; “like vice” only in a way. Two types: hasty (no deliberation; quick or intense impressions) and weak (deliberates but doesn’t abide).  
  • Continent vs hardy: continence overcomes allurements; hardiness endures pains. Continence is better than hardiness.  
  • Softness: yields to pains/pleasures most people resist (often linked to luxury); contrasted with hardness.

- Practical principles: Virtue (natural or trained) preserves the practical “principle” (right end); vice destroys it. Hence the profligate believes bad pleasures are good; the incontinent does not, so can improve.

- Continence concerns adherence to true/right reason “essentially,” not just any opinion. Distinguish stubbornness/obstinacy (resists reason, resembles incontinence) from true continence.

- Not all resolution-changes are incontinent: abandoning for a noble pleasure (truth, as with Neoptolemus) is not base. Deficiency in bodily pleasure is rare; thus incontinence is treated as continence’s main opposite. Temperate differs from continent: the temperate has no bad desires; the continent has them but is not swayed.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Continence stands between deficiency (rare insensibility to bodily pleasures) and excess (incontinence). We often call the temperate “continent” metaphorically: both never act against reason for bodily pleasure, but the continent still has bad desires and resists them; the temperate lacks such desires. Profligates and incontinents both chase bodily pleasures, but the profligate does so by choice/principle, the incontinent against his better judgment.

- Prudence and incontinence are incompatible. People mistake cleverness for prudence; a clever person can be incontinent, but the prudent cannot. The incontinent’s knowledge is inoperative (as if asleep/drunk). His acts are voluntary yet “half-bad”: he intends the good but fails in execution; he is not unjust (no settled malice). Analogy: good laws never enforced vs bad laws enforced. Incontinence from melancholic impulsivity is more curable than resolution-breaking; habit-based incontinence is easier to reform than one rooted in nature; habit becomes “second nature.”

- Turn to pleasure: survey of views—(1) no pleasure good; (2) some good, most bad; (3) all good but none is the highest. Aristotle’s replies: pleasure is not a mere process to restoration but an unimpeded activity of a natural state; some “pleasures” are only medicinal reliefs. Proper pleasures enhance, not impede, their own activities; other pleasures impede. Lack of an “art of pleasure” is no objection. Temperate/prudent avoid excess and the pains tied to appetitive pleasures but have fitting pleasures.

- Since pain is bad, its opposite as such is good; some pleasure may be the highest good because happiness is unimpeded activity (pleasure) and needs external goods to avoid impediments; the “happy on the rack” thesis is false. Universal pursuit of pleasure hints at a single true pleasure aligned with the divine element, though people mistake bodily pleasures (common/accessible) for pleasure simply. Bodily goods admit excess; vice lies in pursuing excess, not necessary pleasures.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- If pleasure were neither good nor bad, then pain would be likewise; but then the good person’s life would not be pleasanter unless his activities were. Hence some pleasures must be good.

- Bodily pleasures: the bad person errs by seeking excess, not by seeking “necessary” pleasures themselves. Faculties that admit excess yield excessive pleasures; bodily goods admit excess. With pain, the bad avoid pain generally, not only excess; notably, the opposite of excessive pleasure is not painful—except to those habituated to excess.

- Why bodily pleasures seem most desirable:
  • They powerfully expel antecedent pains; their intensity appears by contrast, leading to overpursuit.  
  • Two sources of the error that “pleasure isn’t good”: (1) some pleasures manifest bad natures (brutish or viciously habituated); (2) remedial/restorative pleasures signal lack and are only accidentally good, whereas being in a natural, healthy state is better.  
  • Those unable to enjoy higher pleasures chase intensity (even inducing thirst); harmless cases aren’t blamed. The “neutral” state feels painful to many because living functions are laborious; youth’s growth mimics drunkenness and is pleasant. Melancholic temperaments crave relief and slide into profligacy since strong pleasures can expel pain.

- Distinction: naturally pleasant activities (no antecedent pain) do not admit excess; restorative pleasures are only accidentally pleasant.

- Human pleasure can’t be continuous: our composite nature entails conflicting elements; equilibrium feels neither painful nor pleasant. A simple nature (God) enjoys one simple, unmoved activity and truer pleasure than motion. Our love of change betrays a defect; bad natures need change.

- Conclusion: having treated continence/incontinence and pleasure/pain, he turns next to friendship.
