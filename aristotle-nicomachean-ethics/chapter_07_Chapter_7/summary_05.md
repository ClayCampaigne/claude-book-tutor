- If pleasure were neither good nor bad, then pain would be likewise; but then the good person’s life would not be pleasanter unless his activities were. Hence some pleasures must be good.

- Bodily pleasures: the bad person errs by seeking excess, not by seeking “necessary” pleasures themselves. Faculties that admit excess yield excessive pleasures; bodily goods admit excess. With pain, the bad avoid pain generally, not only excess; notably, the opposite of excessive pleasure is not painful—except to those habituated to excess.

- Why bodily pleasures seem most desirable:
  • They powerfully expel antecedent pains; their intensity appears by contrast, leading to overpursuit.  
  • Two sources of the error that “pleasure isn’t good”: (1) some pleasures manifest bad natures (brutish or viciously habituated); (2) remedial/restorative pleasures signal lack and are only accidentally good, whereas being in a natural, healthy state is better.  
  • Those unable to enjoy higher pleasures chase intensity (even inducing thirst); harmless cases aren’t blamed. The “neutral” state feels painful to many because living functions are laborious; youth’s growth mimics drunkenness and is pleasant. Melancholic temperaments crave relief and slide into profligacy since strong pleasures can expel pain.

- Distinction: naturally pleasant activities (no antecedent pain) do not admit excess; restorative pleasures are only accidentally pleasant.

- Human pleasure can’t be continuous: our composite nature entails conflicting elements; equilibrium feels neither painful nor pleasant. A simple nature (God) enjoys one simple, unmoved activity and truer pleasure than motion. Our love of change betrays a defect; bad natures need change.

- Conclusion: having treated continence/incontinence and pleasure/pain, he turns next to friendship.
