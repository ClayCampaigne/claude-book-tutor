- Natural forces (gravity, impenetrability, rigidity, elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical qualities) are immediate, groundless objectifications of will—like human character. They are not themselves causes or effects; only their particular occurrences have causes within space–time. Saying “gravity causes the fall” confuses force with the proximate cause (e.g., earth’s proximity). Forces lie outside the causal chain (and thus outside time), yet express themselves through it.

- Individuality scales with the grade of objectification:
  - Humans: pronounced, opaque individual character and physiognomy; motives can be hidden (via knowledge), making prediction hard; sexual choice becomes a powerful, instinctive passion; brain convolutions show greater asymmetry/variability.
  - Animals: species character predominates; weaker individuality.
  - Plants: no true individuality beyond environmental variation.
  - Inorganic: individuality disappears; only crystals retain a quasi-individual, repeat-form structure; otherwise phenomena are pure expressions of general forces.

- Laws of nature are the unvarying sameness of a force’s phenomena—i.e., the relation of an Idea (a grade of will’s objectification) to its form of manifestation (space, time, causality). The uniformity that seems “ghostly” from the standpoint of particulars is clarified once we accept Kant’s point: time, space, and causality are forms of appearance, not of the thing-in-itself.

- Causal order presupposes one common matter: causality and permanence of substance are interbound; time = possibility of changing states of the same matter; space = possibility of matter’s persistence; matter = union of time and space, hence “through and through causality.” Understanding is the subjective correlative of causality; the world as idea exists only for it.

- Example: a machine manifests original forces (gravity, rigidity, impenetrability); mechanics states the conditions and modes of their appearance, not their inner essence.
