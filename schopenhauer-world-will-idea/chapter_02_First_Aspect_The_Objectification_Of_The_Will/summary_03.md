- Theoretical egoism is acknowledged as irrefutable but impotent (a “small frontier fortress”); philosophy proceeds past it.
- Method: Use our unique double access to our own body (idea and will) as the key for all nature. Since beyond idea nothing is thinkable except will, whatever in objects remains after abstracting their being-as-idea must be will. To ascribe maximum reality to the material world is to ascribe to it what our body has beyond idea: will.
- Clarification of will’s essence: Knowledge and motivation belong only to certain grades of its manifestation (animal/human), not to will itself. Thus saying gravitation is will does not mean the stone acts from motives.
- §20: Voluntary movements are identical with acts of will as they appear in the form of idea. Motives determine only particular acts “here and now,” given the empirical character; they do not ground the will itself, which is groundless and lies outside the principle of sufficient reason (PSR). The body is the necessary condition of action and is the will’s total objectification; pain/pleasure and psychosomatic effects confirm this.
- Etiological (causal) explanations, including physiology, explain when and how phenomena occur, not their inner nature, which they presuppose and label as force, law, character, or will. Teleology of the body reflects will: organs are objectified desires; individual physique expresses individual character.
- §21: Extending by analogy, the inner nature of plants, crystals, magnetism, electricity, chemical affinities, and gravitation is the same will known most immediately in us. Idea is mere appearance; will alone is the thing-in-itself, differing in degree of manifestation across nature.
- §22: To think the thing-in-itself at all, we must borrow names from its manifestations, though it is never itself an object.
