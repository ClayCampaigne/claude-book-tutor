- Role split:
  - Etiology (physics) explains when/where particular phenomena occur by citing proximate causes and the universal forces presupposed in them; it catalogs and distinguishes forces and their lawful effects under conditions. A “law of nature” is only a generalized fact; a complete physics would be a complete register of such facts with no unknown forces in unorganized nature.
  - Morphology surveys enduring organic forms; causes of individual organisms reduce to procreation (and rarely generatio aequivoca).
  - Philosophy treats the universals: original forces as grades of the will’s objectification (thing-in-itself), and, apart from will, the world as idea.

- Against reductionism: It is an error to deny original forces or to reduce higher grades (life, organism) to lower (mechanism, chemism, electricity). Historical targets: Descartes/atomists; modern physiological reduction to “form and combination”; Lamarck’s heat/electricity. Such views replace content with form, making organisms chance aggregates rather than special Ideas (Aristotle’s forma substantialis).

- Unity-in-diversity: The one will underlies all Ideas, yielding pervasive analogies:
  - Biology: unité de plan and comparative anatomy; polarity as a fundamental type.
  - Inorganic: analogies among electricity, magnetism, chemical attraction, gravitation. These are not identical or mutually reducible.

- Hierarchical emergence by conflict: When lower forces contend for matter, a higher Idea arises, subduing but retaining them in a subordinate, analogous way (e.g., ossification ~ crystallization; humours ~ chemical combination). Chemical/physical laws operate in organisms but are mastered by vital force—tools, not essence.

- Developmental arc: Will first appears in generatio aequivoca, then via assimilation to germ → organic moisture → plant → animal → human. Higher forms “swallow” lower, realizing their tendencies at a higher grade; the subdued lower forces persist as opposing tendencies that can even strengthen the higher (e.g., magnet vs gravitation).
