- With the advent of brain/ganglion (the μηχανη for seeking/choosing food), the world as idea arises “at a stroke”: subject/object, time, space, multiplicity, causality appear as a second, distinct aspect alongside blind will. Previously infallible, lawlike workings (unorganized/vegetative nature) lose certainty once this image-world encroaches.
- Animals, limited to perceptual ideas (no concepts), become susceptible to illusion and deception; they are bound to the present. Two cross-encroachments occur:
  - Mechanical instincts: blind will acts within otherwise motive-guided behavior, mimicking rational design without knowledge.
  - Clairvoyance (in humans): the light of knowledge penetrates vegetative functions, illuminating the blind workshop of will.
- In humans, reason adds concepts, reflection, foresight, deliberation, and conscious volition. But instinct disappears; deliberation breeds irresolution and error. Illusive motives can falsify the will’s expression (e.g., superstition leading Agamemnon to sacrifice, a miser to give alms for imagined gain). Knowledge is originally a mere organ for will’s preservation, though it can be freed (Book III: art) and ultimately turn back to negate will (Book IV: resignation).
- §28: Will, the thing-in-itself, is one and unmoved; multiplicity (Ideas, individuals, their strife) is only its manner of appearance. Man’s Idea requires the whole graded series (inorganic→plant→animal→man) for full objectification; outer interdependence (ecosystems, cosmic conditions) mirrors inner necessity—the “hungry” will lives on itself, yielding pursuit, anxiety, suffering, and explaining nature’s deep analogies and teleology.
- Teleology:
  - Inner: organismal parts coordinated for individual/species maintenance.
  - Outer: relations among unorganized/organized nature sustaining life.
- Ideas can be viewed as simple, timeless acts of will; individuals are their spatiotemporal manifestations. Lower grades exhibit unity in a single act (force; crystallization). Higher grades require temporal development: plants unfold organs; animals must act (species empirical character) to complete their Idea. In man, empirical character is individual; the underlying intelligible character (Kant) is a timeless act of will expressing itself through necessitated actions. Plants naïvely reveal character in form; animals via observed actions; humans can dissimulate through reason.
