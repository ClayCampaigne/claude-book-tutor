- Instinct exemplifies nature’s residual teleology: behaviors (e.g., valisneria’s sexed flowers meeting at the surface; male stag-beetle larva enlarging its pupal chamber) look end-directed without any conception of ends. Likewise, all natural construction “as if for ends” is really the one will’s self-agreement appearing under our forms (space, time, causality).
- This harmony only sustains species and general life-conditions; it does not secure individuals. The will’s inner contradiction reappears as ceaseless conflict among individuals and among natural forces, battling for matter, space, and time (matter = space–time unified through causality).
- Conclusion of Part II: The world is through and through will (thing-in-itself) and through and through idea (appearance relative to a subject). Each person is both knowing subject and will—microcosm matching macrocosm. Further books will deepen and answer remaining questions.
- Clarification on “final end” of will: Misconceived. The principle of sufficient reason (including motivation) governs phenomena only. Causes explain when/where a force manifests, not the force itself; similarly, motives determine particular acts, not that one wills at all—this stems from the groundless, timeless intelligible character (will).
- Will has no ultimate aim; it is endless striving. Paradigms: gravity’s perpetual tendency; life cycles (plant, animal); continuous organic renewal; human desires that, once satisfied, fade and yield new desires—happiness as rapid alternation, sorrow as slow, stagnation as ennui.
- Particular acts have ends; the whole will has none. The sole self-knowledge of will-as-whole is the total world of perception, its mirror and objectification, whose content will be examined next.
