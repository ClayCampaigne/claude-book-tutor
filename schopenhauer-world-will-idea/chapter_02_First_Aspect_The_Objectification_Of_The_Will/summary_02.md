- Key identification: The inner meaning of our bodily actions is will. The body is given to us in two irreducibly different ways: as idea (object among objects, under causal laws) and as will (immediately). A genuine act of will and the corresponding bodily movement are one and the same event, not cause and effect; the body is the objectification/objectivity of will.

- Scope: This identity extends to all bodily movements, including involuntary ones; ultimately, the entire body is will become idea.

- Epistemic consequences:
  - Only executed action counts as will; prior “resolutions” are abstract intentions in reason. In reality, willing and acting are identical.
  - Bodily impressions are immediate affections of will: pain (contrary to will) and pleasure (consonant with it). These are not ideas. Only minimal, specific stimulations of the “objective senses” (sight, hearing, touch) can remain mere data for understanding; stronger or atypical stimuli affect the will (e.g., in nervous weakness, yielding diffuse discomfort).
  - Emotions directly disturb bodily functions, evidencing the identity of will and body.
  - We know will only in particular acts in time; knowledge of will is inseparable from the body.

- Status of this knowledge: It cannot be demonstrated from other truths; it is immediate, sui generis “philosophical truth,” relating a perceptual idea (body) to what is not idea (will). Alternative formulations: “My body and my will are one”; “my body is will objectified.”

- Against theoretical egoism: Our special double access applies only to our own body. One can either attribute this uniqueness to our relation to that object, or (madly) claim only one’s body is both will and idea and all else mere phantoms. The latter is an unrefutable but idle sceptical pose; we set it aside.

- Method for the world: Use our double knowledge as the key for all nature. By analogy, since other objects are ideas like our body, what remains of them beyond being idea must be the same as what in us is called will. Thus, the inner nature of all phenomena is will; and explanations in the domain of causality (first class of representations) ultimately draw their deeper sense from motivation (fourth class).
