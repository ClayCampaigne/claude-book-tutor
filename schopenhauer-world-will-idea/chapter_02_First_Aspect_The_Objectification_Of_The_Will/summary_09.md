- Causality has meaning only within time, space, and the matter that unites them; it fixes when/where phenomena occur. Original natural forces, as immediate objectifications of will (thing-in-itself), lie outside these forms and thus beyond etiological explanation.
- Illustrative “machine” sequence: the same matter successively manifests gravity, rigidity, impenetrability (mechanics), then—if a magnet intervenes—magnetism; with zinc/copper/acid—galvanism; with heat and acid—chemical combustion; thereafter crystallization; then, upon dissolution and mixture, vegetation. In each case, causes specify the conditions for appearance “here and now,” but the force itself is groundless will, outside time, merely awaiting conditions to “take possession” of matter and supersede prior forces. Time pertains to phenomena, not to forces (e.g., dormant chemical powers, galvanism, or a millennia-old seed).
- Malebranche’s “occasional causes” is endorsed: causes occasion the manifestation of the one will; they do not ground inner nature. Likewise in action: motives determine only the appearance of a fixed, groundless character, not the character itself.
- Program for physics (etiology): seek invariant conditions of phenomena; reduce varieties to presupposed original forces; carefully distinguish differences due to force vs. circumstance; avoid multiplying forces or conflating distinct ones. Physics must never invoke will (or God) in place of causes; every movement requires a cause (mechanical, stimulus, or motive). Original forces remain qualitates occultae for physics; they do not break the causal chain. A completed physics would enumerate forces and their lawful effects under conditions; laws are generalized facts, not inner explanations.
