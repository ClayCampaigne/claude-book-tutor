- Critique of etiology’s foundation: Explanations that rest on “occult qualities” (unanalysed basic forces) leave inner nature as unknown as the original problem. Philosophy must begin from what is immediately known—our own will—rather than from abstract natural forces.
- Method inversion: Use the fourth class of representations (motivation) to illuminate the first (causation). From our inner experience of willing→bodily action, infer that lifeless bodies’ causal changes express the same inner essence—will—differing only in degree.
- Spinoza’s stone: If conscious, the stone would think it moves by will—and it would be right. The imparted impulse functions for it as a motive does for us; cohesion, gravity, rigidity are will’s manifestations. Necessity of effects presupposes an inner being: in us, character; in things, quality; immediately known, will.
- Historical echoes: Augustine’s universal “appetite” in things; Euler’s intuition of gravitation as “desire,” though he retreats to ether to avoid “occult” attraction.
- Metaphysical frame: Space and time (principium individuationis) apply to appearance, not to the thing-in-itself. As thing-in-itself, will is outside space, time, and multiplicity—one, indivisible. “More/less” pertains only to grades of objectification (visibility), not to will itself. The will is entire in each thing; studying any individual can disclose essence.
- Plato’s Ideas: The fixed, timeless grades of will’s objectification are the Ideas—eternal prototypes of which individual things are copies.
- §26 Forces as lowest objectifications: Universal and specific natural forces (gravity, impenetrability, elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical qualities) are immediate, groundless manifestations of will, like human character. Only their particular expressions fall under causality. Forces are not causes; they are presupposed conditions. Thus the cause of a stone’s fall is the earth’s proximity, not “gravity” as a cause.
