- Transition from phenomenon to thing-in-itself: All objects/ideas are mere appearances; only will is the thing-in-itself. The same inner will manifests across grades—from blind natural forces to deliberate human action—differing in degree, not kind.
- Naming and method: To think the thing-in-itself we must borrow from its clearest manifestation—the human will (denominatio a potiori). Schopenhauer extends “will” beyond motive-guided, rational volition to name the genus of all inner efficacy in nature. He inverts the usual hierarchy: do not subsume will under force; rather, think every force as will. “Force” is an abstraction from phenomena within causality; “will” is known immediately from within, prior to subject–object, thus explaining the inner essence rather than restating appearances.
- Metaphysics of will (§23): As thing-in-itself, will is outside all forms of representation (subject–object, PSR), and thus outside time, space, and multiplicity (principium individuationis). It is groundless and one (not numerically one), while its manifestations are innumerable and strictly subject to the PSR.
- Freedom/necessity reconciliation: Self-consciousness gives awareness of will’s uncaused nature (felt as freedom), but individual actions are necessitated by motives acting on a fixed empirical character; hence the a priori belief in freedom vs a posteriori recognition of necessity.
- Will without knowledge: Instinct shows will’s blind activity (nest-building, web-spinning, etc.). The same holds in vegetative human functions (digestion, growth). The whole body is objectified will; in organisms will operates via “stimuli.”
- Causal taxonomy: “Cause” (strict sense) involves reciprocal change, proportionality, and calculability (mechanics/chemistry, unorganized bodies). “Stimulus” lacks proportional reaction and linear scaling; its effect cannot be measured by input intensity.
