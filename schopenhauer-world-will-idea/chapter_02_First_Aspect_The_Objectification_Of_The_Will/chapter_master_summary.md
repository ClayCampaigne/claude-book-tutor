<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
This chapter shifts from Book I’s analysis of the form of representation to the inner content of perceptual ideas—why they move us instead of remaining empty images. A survey of possible sources shows their limits under the principle of sufficient reason (PSR): philosophy’s “object” behind ideas collapses back into representation; mathematics yields only quantitative relations in space and time; natural science either classifies stable forms (morphology) or states causal laws of change (etiology), both presupposing fundamental forces without revealing their inner nature. Since causality itself is an a priori form valid only for objects, all investigation “from without” reaches names, images, and laws, not essence.

The decisive turn is “from within.” Our body is given in two irreducible ways: as idea among ideas and immediately as will. Every genuine act of will is identical with the bodily movement that presents it; pleasure and pain are direct affections of will. This immediate, non-inferential knowledge cannot be demonstrated from other truths; it is a sui generis philosophical datum. Setting aside the idle but irrefutable stance of theoretical egoism, we use analogy: what in us is will is, beyond its being-as-idea, the inner nature of all phenomena. Thus will is the thing-in-itself; idea is its appearance.

As thing-in-itself, will is outside the PSR, time, space, and multiplicity—groundless and one—while its manifestations are many and strictly law-governed. Its grades of objectification run from blind forces (gravity, electricity, chemical affinity), through life (stimulus), to animal and human action (motives). Cause, stimulus, and motive determine only where and when a force shows itself, never what it is. Physics rightly catalogs laws and conditions but cannot deduce original forces; reduction of higher to lower grades confuses content with form.

Human freedom and necessity reconcile thus: the intelligible character (a timeless act of will) underlies an empirically necessitated series of actions shaped by motives. Organisms display inner teleology (organs as objectified desires) and nature shows outer teleology (reciprocal fit), both appearances of the one will under our forms of cognition. Nature is universal strife: higher Ideas subdue lower yet remain opposed by them; death returns matter to lower forces. With the advent of brain, the world as idea arises to serve will; it can mislead, and later be liberated. The world is through and through will and through and through idea. Will has no final end—only ceaseless striving; particular purposes belong to actions, not to the whole. The world of perception is will’s mirror, whose aesthetic and ethical bearings follow in the next books.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Shift from Book I’s form of representation to the content and “peculiar significance” of perceptual ideas: why they speak to us rather than remain meaningless images.
- Survey of possible sources:
  - Philosophy largely posits a substrate “object” behind ideas, but since objectivity presupposes a subject, this collapses back into representation; PSR only links ideas to ideas, not to anything beyond representation.
  - Mathematics treats only quantity (how-many/how-much) in space and time; it yields relations, not inner meaning.
  - Natural science divides into:
    - Morphology: description and classification of stable forms (botany, zoology, mineralogy), revealing analogies (unité de plan) but not origins or inner essence; generation remains mysterious.
    - Etiology: causal explanation of changes (mechanics, physics, chemistry, physiology). It presupposes fundamental forces and properties (e.g., matter, weight, inertia), and states lawful spatiotemporal sequences, but never the inner nature of forces. Causality itself is a form of representation, known a priori, valid only for objects.
- Conclusion: Investigating “from without” reaches only images, names, and laws; the thing’s inner nature remains inaccessible via PSR.
- Turn “from within”: the knower is embodied. The body is given doubly:
  - As idea among ideas (perception, subject to causal laws).
  - Immediately as will. Every genuine act of will is identical with a bodily movement (not cause and effect but one and the same event given in two modes). This immediate access provides the key to the world’s inner essence.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Key identification: The inner meaning of our bodily actions is will. The body is given to us in two irreducibly different ways: as idea (object among objects, under causal laws) and as will (immediately). A genuine act of will and the corresponding bodily movement are one and the same event, not cause and effect; the body is the objectification/objectivity of will.

- Scope: This identity extends to all bodily movements, including involuntary ones; ultimately, the entire body is will become idea.

- Epistemic consequences:
  - Only executed action counts as will; prior “resolutions” are abstract intentions in reason. In reality, willing and acting are identical.
  - Bodily impressions are immediate affections of will: pain (contrary to will) and pleasure (consonant with it). These are not ideas. Only minimal, specific stimulations of the “objective senses” (sight, hearing, touch) can remain mere data for understanding; stronger or atypical stimuli affect the will (e.g., in nervous weakness, yielding diffuse discomfort).
  - Emotions directly disturb bodily functions, evidencing the identity of will and body.
  - We know will only in particular acts in time; knowledge of will is inseparable from the body.

- Status of this knowledge: It cannot be demonstrated from other truths; it is immediate, sui generis “philosophical truth,” relating a perceptual idea (body) to what is not idea (will). Alternative formulations: “My body and my will are one”; “my body is will objectified.”

- Against theoretical egoism: Our special double access applies only to our own body. One can either attribute this uniqueness to our relation to that object, or (madly) claim only one’s body is both will and idea and all else mere phantoms. The latter is an unrefutable but idle sceptical pose; we set it aside.

- Method for the world: Use our double knowledge as the key for all nature. By analogy, since other objects are ideas like our body, what remains of them beyond being idea must be the same as what in us is called will. Thus, the inner nature of all phenomena is will; and explanations in the domain of causality (first class of representations) ultimately draw their deeper sense from motivation (fourth class).
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Theoretical egoism is acknowledged as irrefutable but impotent (a “small frontier fortress”); philosophy proceeds past it.
- Method: Use our unique double access to our own body (idea and will) as the key for all nature. Since beyond idea nothing is thinkable except will, whatever in objects remains after abstracting their being-as-idea must be will. To ascribe maximum reality to the material world is to ascribe to it what our body has beyond idea: will.
- Clarification of will’s essence: Knowledge and motivation belong only to certain grades of its manifestation (animal/human), not to will itself. Thus saying gravitation is will does not mean the stone acts from motives.
- §20: Voluntary movements are identical with acts of will as they appear in the form of idea. Motives determine only particular acts “here and now,” given the empirical character; they do not ground the will itself, which is groundless and lies outside the principle of sufficient reason (PSR). The body is the necessary condition of action and is the will’s total objectification; pain/pleasure and psychosomatic effects confirm this.
- Etiological (causal) explanations, including physiology, explain when and how phenomena occur, not their inner nature, which they presuppose and label as force, law, character, or will. Teleology of the body reflects will: organs are objectified desires; individual physique expresses individual character.
- §21: Extending by analogy, the inner nature of plants, crystals, magnetism, electricity, chemical affinities, and gravitation is the same will known most immediately in us. Idea is mere appearance; will alone is the thing-in-itself, differing in degree of manifestation across nature.
- §22: To think the thing-in-itself at all, we must borrow names from its manifestations, though it is never itself an object.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Transition from phenomenon to thing-in-itself: All objects/ideas are mere appearances; only will is the thing-in-itself. The same inner will manifests across grades—from blind natural forces to deliberate human action—differing in degree, not kind.
- Naming and method: To think the thing-in-itself we must borrow from its clearest manifestation—the human will (denominatio a potiori). Schopenhauer extends “will” beyond motive-guided, rational volition to name the genus of all inner efficacy in nature. He inverts the usual hierarchy: do not subsume will under force; rather, think every force as will. “Force” is an abstraction from phenomena within causality; “will” is known immediately from within, prior to subject–object, thus explaining the inner essence rather than restating appearances.
- Metaphysics of will (§23): As thing-in-itself, will is outside all forms of representation (subject–object, PSR), and thus outside time, space, and multiplicity (principium individuationis). It is groundless and one (not numerically one), while its manifestations are innumerable and strictly subject to the PSR.
- Freedom/necessity reconciliation: Self-consciousness gives awareness of will’s uncaused nature (felt as freedom), but individual actions are necessitated by motives acting on a fixed empirical character; hence the a priori belief in freedom vs a posteriori recognition of necessity.
- Will without knowledge: Instinct shows will’s blind activity (nest-building, web-spinning, etc.). The same holds in vegetative human functions (digestion, growth). The whole body is objectified will; in organisms will operates via “stimuli.”
- Causal taxonomy: “Cause” (strict sense) involves reciprocal change, proportionality, and calculability (mechanics/chemistry, unorganized bodies). “Stimulus” lacks proportional reaction and linear scaling; its effect cannot be measured by input intensity.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Distinction among causal orders:
  - Cause (strict sense): reciprocal change (action = reaction), proportionality, calculability; governs unorganized bodies (mechanics/chemistry).
  - Stimulus: no proportional reaction; nonlinear effects (small increases can greatly amplify or nullify effects); characterizes organic/vegetative processes. It mediates between cause and motive, sometimes nearer one or the other.
  - Motive: causality with knowledge; yet, like stimuli and causes, acts with necessity. All three determine only when/where a force manifests, not its inner nature, which is will.
- Examples of transitions:
  - Plant sap rise: stimulus approaching causal explanation.
  - Hedysarum/Mimosa movements: stimuli approaching motive-like action.
  - Pupillary contraction: stimulus shading into motive (avoid retinal pain).
  - Erection, disgust/vomiting: ideas as motives operating with stimulus-like necessity.
  - Instinct bridges stimulus-driven movement and motive-guided action.
  - Breathing: “mixed,” but ultimately motive-governed (ideas can accelerate, check, or even suppress it; cases of voluntary suffocation). Motives exhibit necessity; only counter-motives can neutralize them.
- Extension of will:
  - Animals and plants: their actions/life processes (guided by motives or stimuli) are manifestations of the same will that constitutes our body.
  - Inorganic nature: gravity, magnetism, electricity, crystallization, chemical affinities manifest will at its lowest, blind grade.
  - Apparent contrast (individual human “freedom” vs law-bound nature) stems from individuality and knowledge modifying motive-effects in us, versus universal, invariant conditions in unorganized phenomena.
- Kantian framing (§24):
  - Space, time, causality (forms of the PSR) are subjective forms of appearance—boundary between subject and object—and not properties of the thing-in-itself.
  - Multiplicity, change, matter belong to these forms; whatever in phenomena cannot be reduced to them directly reveals the thing-in-itself.
  - Thus what pertains to form is most exhaustively knowable; the inner essence (later identified as will) is not.
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Reaffirming Kantian groundwork: time, space, and causality (forms of the PSR) belong to appearance (idea) only. Multiplicity, change, matter, and all that is knowable via these forms pertain to the form of representation, not to the thing-in-itself.
- Criterion: Whatever in phenomena cannot be reduced to or explained by time, space, and causality is precisely where the thing-in-itself directly shows itself.
- Epistemic split:
  - Sciences a priori (mathematics, pure natural science) achieve complete clarity because they treat only form—relations among ideas—never inner content.
  - Any empirical content introduces an inexplicable remainder (groundless), since the thing-in-itself only appears within, but is not identical with, the PSR’s forms.
- Limits of etiology: It states when/where phenomena occur under laws, but presupposes basic forces (gravitation, elasticity, electricity, etc.) that remain qualitates occultae—the content that cannot be deduced.
- Against reductionism: Attempts to reduce life → chemistry → mechanism → geometry → arithmetic evacuate content, yielding mere subject-dependent form (a Fichtean phantom). Historically cited: Democritus, Descartes’ vortices, Lesage, Reil, crude materialism, and Newtonian-style ether-wave optics. Some reductions succeed (e.g., magnetism from electricity), but irreducible original forces persist.
- Analogy to will: For any effect we can cite causes for its occurrence “here and now,” but never why a thing acts at all or in that specific way—its definitive quality (substantial form) is groundless, like a human’s character. This unfathomable inner nature in even a mote (weight, impenetrability) is identical in essence with what in us is called will.
- Methodological pivot: Philosophy, seeking unconditioned knowledge, must begin from what is immediately and most securely known (our inner access), not from external etiological constructions.
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Critique of etiology’s foundation: Explanations that rest on “occult qualities” (unanalysed basic forces) leave inner nature as unknown as the original problem. Philosophy must begin from what is immediately known—our own will—rather than from abstract natural forces.
- Method inversion: Use the fourth class of representations (motivation) to illuminate the first (causation). From our inner experience of willing→bodily action, infer that lifeless bodies’ causal changes express the same inner essence—will—differing only in degree.
- Spinoza’s stone: If conscious, the stone would think it moves by will—and it would be right. The imparted impulse functions for it as a motive does for us; cohesion, gravity, rigidity are will’s manifestations. Necessity of effects presupposes an inner being: in us, character; in things, quality; immediately known, will.
- Historical echoes: Augustine’s universal “appetite” in things; Euler’s intuition of gravitation as “desire,” though he retreats to ether to avoid “occult” attraction.
- Metaphysical frame: Space and time (principium individuationis) apply to appearance, not to the thing-in-itself. As thing-in-itself, will is outside space, time, and multiplicity—one, indivisible. “More/less” pertains only to grades of objectification (visibility), not to will itself. The will is entire in each thing; studying any individual can disclose essence.
- Plato’s Ideas: The fixed, timeless grades of will’s objectification are the Ideas—eternal prototypes of which individual things are copies.
- §26 Forces as lowest objectifications: Universal and specific natural forces (gravity, impenetrability, elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical qualities) are immediate, groundless manifestations of will, like human character. Only their particular expressions fall under causality. Forces are not causes; they are presupposed conditions. Thus the cause of a stone’s fall is the earth’s proximity, not “gravity” as a cause.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Natural forces (gravity, impenetrability, rigidity, elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical qualities) are immediate, groundless objectifications of will—like human character. They are not themselves causes or effects; only their particular occurrences have causes within space–time. Saying “gravity causes the fall” confuses force with the proximate cause (e.g., earth’s proximity). Forces lie outside the causal chain (and thus outside time), yet express themselves through it.

- Individuality scales with the grade of objectification:
  - Humans: pronounced, opaque individual character and physiognomy; motives can be hidden (via knowledge), making prediction hard; sexual choice becomes a powerful, instinctive passion; brain convolutions show greater asymmetry/variability.
  - Animals: species character predominates; weaker individuality.
  - Plants: no true individuality beyond environmental variation.
  - Inorganic: individuality disappears; only crystals retain a quasi-individual, repeat-form structure; otherwise phenomena are pure expressions of general forces.

- Laws of nature are the unvarying sameness of a force’s phenomena—i.e., the relation of an Idea (a grade of will’s objectification) to its form of manifestation (space, time, causality). The uniformity that seems “ghostly” from the standpoint of particulars is clarified once we accept Kant’s point: time, space, and causality are forms of appearance, not of the thing-in-itself.

- Causal order presupposes one common matter: causality and permanence of substance are interbound; time = possibility of changing states of the same matter; space = possibility of matter’s persistence; matter = union of time and space, hence “through and through causality.” Understanding is the subjective correlative of causality; the world as idea exists only for it.

- Example: a machine manifests original forces (gravity, rigidity, impenetrability); mechanics states the conditions and modes of their appearance, not their inner essence.
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Causality has meaning only within time, space, and the matter that unites them; it fixes when/where phenomena occur. Original natural forces, as immediate objectifications of will (thing-in-itself), lie outside these forms and thus beyond etiological explanation.
- Illustrative “machine” sequence: the same matter successively manifests gravity, rigidity, impenetrability (mechanics), then—if a magnet intervenes—magnetism; with zinc/copper/acid—galvanism; with heat and acid—chemical combustion; thereafter crystallization; then, upon dissolution and mixture, vegetation. In each case, causes specify the conditions for appearance “here and now,” but the force itself is groundless will, outside time, merely awaiting conditions to “take possession” of matter and supersede prior forces. Time pertains to phenomena, not to forces (e.g., dormant chemical powers, galvanism, or a millennia-old seed).
- Malebranche’s “occasional causes” is endorsed: causes occasion the manifestation of the one will; they do not ground inner nature. Likewise in action: motives determine only the appearance of a fixed, groundless character, not the character itself.
- Program for physics (etiology): seek invariant conditions of phenomena; reduce varieties to presupposed original forces; carefully distinguish differences due to force vs. circumstance; avoid multiplying forces or conflating distinct ones. Physics must never invoke will (or God) in place of causes; every movement requires a cause (mechanical, stimulus, or motive). Original forces remain qualitates occultae for physics; they do not break the causal chain. A completed physics would enumerate forces and their lawful effects under conditions; laws are generalized facts, not inner explanations.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Role split:
  - Etiology (physics) explains when/where particular phenomena occur by citing proximate causes and the universal forces presupposed in them; it catalogs and distinguishes forces and their lawful effects under conditions. A “law of nature” is only a generalized fact; a complete physics would be a complete register of such facts with no unknown forces in unorganized nature.
  - Morphology surveys enduring organic forms; causes of individual organisms reduce to procreation (and rarely generatio aequivoca).
  - Philosophy treats the universals: original forces as grades of the will’s objectification (thing-in-itself), and, apart from will, the world as idea.

- Against reductionism: It is an error to deny original forces or to reduce higher grades (life, organism) to lower (mechanism, chemism, electricity). Historical targets: Descartes/atomists; modern physiological reduction to “form and combination”; Lamarck’s heat/electricity. Such views replace content with form, making organisms chance aggregates rather than special Ideas (Aristotle’s forma substantialis).

- Unity-in-diversity: The one will underlies all Ideas, yielding pervasive analogies:
  - Biology: unité de plan and comparative anatomy; polarity as a fundamental type.
  - Inorganic: analogies among electricity, magnetism, chemical attraction, gravitation. These are not identical or mutually reducible.

- Hierarchical emergence by conflict: When lower forces contend for matter, a higher Idea arises, subduing but retaining them in a subordinate, analogous way (e.g., ossification ~ crystallization; humours ~ chemical combination). Chemical/physical laws operate in organisms but are mastered by vital force—tools, not essence.

- Developmental arc: Will first appears in generatio aequivoca, then via assimilation to germ → organic moisture → plant → animal → human. Higher forms “swallow” lower, realizing their tendencies at a higher grade; the subdued lower forces persist as opposing tendencies that can even strengthen the higher (e.g., magnet vs gravitation).
</CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>
- Organisms manifest a higher Idea (grade of will) that has conquered lower Ideas (physical/chemical forces) via assimilative subjugation; therefore they cannot be explained from those forces alone. The single will seeks its highest possible objectification, relinquishing lower grades after conflict to appear more powerfully in higher ones.
- Conquest is ongoing: subdued forces persistently resist. Hence:
  - Effort against gravity (e.g., holding an arm out) soon yields to it.
  - Health is precarious, always shadowed by discomfort from vegetative resistance; digestion temporarily debilitates higher functions.
  - The burden of life entails sleep and culminates in death, when lower forces, aided by circumstances, reclaim matter from the organism.
  - An organism’s expression of its species-Idea is only what remains after subtracting energy spent subduing lower forces; greater subjugation approaches the ideal (beauty).
- Nature is universal strife: each grade of will fights for matter, space, time; phenomena incessantly displace one another to express their Idea. This self-conflict of will appears:
  - Biotically (predation, parasitism, intra-organismal assimilation, plant strangulation).
  - Inorganically (crystal interference, magnetism imposing on iron, galvanism overriding chemistry).
  - Cosmically (planet–sun tension; motion as primordial; nebular hypothesis; systemic drifts), exhibiting aimless striving across boundless space/time—universal forms of will’s appearance.
- At the lowest grade, matter is the strife of attraction and repulsion (gravity vs impenetrability), a blind, law-governed impulse without individuality.
- Ascending grades shift from stimulus-driven activity (plants, vegetative animal functions) to motive-guided action requiring consciousness; the brain (or ganglion) is the organ of this “machine.” With it, the world as idea—subject/object, time, space, causality—arises, newly interfacing with and modifying will’s previously blind, regular workings.
</CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>
- With the advent of brain/ganglion (the μηχανη for seeking/choosing food), the world as idea arises “at a stroke”: subject/object, time, space, multiplicity, causality appear as a second, distinct aspect alongside blind will. Previously infallible, lawlike workings (unorganized/vegetative nature) lose certainty once this image-world encroaches.
- Animals, limited to perceptual ideas (no concepts), become susceptible to illusion and deception; they are bound to the present. Two cross-encroachments occur:
  - Mechanical instincts: blind will acts within otherwise motive-guided behavior, mimicking rational design without knowledge.
  - Clairvoyance (in humans): the light of knowledge penetrates vegetative functions, illuminating the blind workshop of will.
- In humans, reason adds concepts, reflection, foresight, deliberation, and conscious volition. But instinct disappears; deliberation breeds irresolution and error. Illusive motives can falsify the will’s expression (e.g., superstition leading Agamemnon to sacrifice, a miser to give alms for imagined gain). Knowledge is originally a mere organ for will’s preservation, though it can be freed (Book III: art) and ultimately turn back to negate will (Book IV: resignation).
- §28: Will, the thing-in-itself, is one and unmoved; multiplicity (Ideas, individuals, their strife) is only its manner of appearance. Man’s Idea requires the whole graded series (inorganic→plant→animal→man) for full objectification; outer interdependence (ecosystems, cosmic conditions) mirrors inner necessity—the “hungry” will lives on itself, yielding pursuit, anxiety, suffering, and explaining nature’s deep analogies and teleology.
- Teleology:
  - Inner: organismal parts coordinated for individual/species maintenance.
  - Outer: relations among unorganized/organized nature sustaining life.
- Ideas can be viewed as simple, timeless acts of will; individuals are their spatiotemporal manifestations. Lower grades exhibit unity in a single act (force; crystallization). Higher grades require temporal development: plants unfold organs; animals must act (species empirical character) to complete their Idea. In man, empirical character is individual; the underlying intelligible character (Kant) is a timeless act of will expressing itself through necessitated actions. Plants naïvely reveal character in form; animals via observed actions; humans can dissimulate through reason.
</CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>
- Kantian frame: Distinguish empirical character (time-bound series of actions) from intelligible character (timeless, indivisible act of will). The intelligible character coincides with the Platonic Idea, i.e., the original act of will. This applies not only to individuals but to species (plants/animals) and even to each original force of inorganic nature.

- Degrees of “naïveté” in manifestation: Plants reveal their whole character immediately in form (innocent blind striving, no knowledge); animals reveal it through actions; humans can dissimulate due to reason, so their will is veiled. Guilt belongs to willing with knowledge, not to willing as such.

- Inner teleology (organism): Unorganized nature manifests an Idea in a single, uniform way (no inner design). Organisms manifest an Idea through many coexisting parts and developmental stages; the unity of the Idea reappears as necessary causal interrelation of parts as means and ends. This unity-through-relations belongs to appearance (space, time, causality), not to the thing-in-itself (will).

- Hence Kant’s point: both design in organisms and lawfulness in inorganic nature are contributed by our understanding; they pertain to phenomena. Our wonder at “design” and at strict law is the same: the unity of the Idea showing up under multiplicity.

- Outer teleology (environmental fit): Because one will objectifies in all Ideas, there is a universal, reciprocal adaptation among nature’s parts. Analogy: as outward circumstances shape only the accidental expression of an individual’s fixed character, so environments and species mutually accommodate one another in manifestation. Crucially, this agreement must be conceived outside time (Ideas are timeless): earlier phenomena (e.g., planetary motions, land/sea, atmosphere, light, warmth) are “in harmony” with later life-forms; later, higher objectifications do not derive priority from temporal order.

- Instinct as model: Nature’s seeming foresight (nests, dams, provisioning, traps; plant reproductive strategies; specific anatomical adaptations) is end-like action without knowledge. Both inner and outer teleology are appearances of the one will’s self-agreement, rendered as means–end relations only within our forms of cognition (space, time, causality).
</CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>
- Instinct exemplifies nature’s residual teleology: behaviors (e.g., valisneria’s sexed flowers meeting at the surface; male stag-beetle larva enlarging its pupal chamber) look end-directed without any conception of ends. Likewise, all natural construction “as if for ends” is really the one will’s self-agreement appearing under our forms (space, time, causality).
- This harmony only sustains species and general life-conditions; it does not secure individuals. The will’s inner contradiction reappears as ceaseless conflict among individuals and among natural forces, battling for matter, space, and time (matter = space–time unified through causality).
- Conclusion of Part II: The world is through and through will (thing-in-itself) and through and through idea (appearance relative to a subject). Each person is both knowing subject and will—microcosm matching macrocosm. Further books will deepen and answer remaining questions.
- Clarification on “final end” of will: Misconceived. The principle of sufficient reason (including motivation) governs phenomena only. Causes explain when/where a force manifests, not the force itself; similarly, motives determine particular acts, not that one wills at all—this stems from the groundless, timeless intelligible character (will).
- Will has no ultimate aim; it is endless striving. Paradigms: gravity’s perpetual tendency; life cycles (plant, animal); continuous organic renewal; human desires that, once satisfied, fade and yield new desires—happiness as rapid alternation, sorrow as slow, stagnation as ennui.
- Particular acts have ends; the whole will has none. The sole self-knowledge of will-as-whole is the total world of perception, its mirror and objectification, whose content will be examined next.
