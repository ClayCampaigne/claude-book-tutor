- The Idea is directly and fully perceptible; anything that cannot be made object of perception is a concept. Allegory, by definition, makes a work mean something other than what it shows, thus signifies a concept and diverts the beholder from intuitive perception to abstraction—contrary to art’s end.
- In allegory the goal is reached as soon as one “gets what it stands for,” after which attention leaves the perceptual content. Hence allegories in visual arts function like hieroglyphics; whatever artistic value they possess belongs to them not as allegories but as depictions.
- Reapplies the “nominal vs real significance” distinction: nominal = the allegorical label (e.g., “Genius of Fame”); real = what is actually seen (a beautiful winged youth and boys), which alone expresses an Idea. Turning to the nominal is a fall from Idea to concept and can even falsify perception (e.g., Correggio’s Night uses impossible light for an allegorical motive).
- Such works serve two ends (concept and Idea); only the latter is proper to art. Allegory is likened to mixing art with utility (statues as candelabra/caryatids), which true connoisseurs reject.
- Any emotional impact of allegory stems from abstract thought and could be matched by a written legend (“fame,” “Le temps découvre la vérité”), confirming allegory’s discursive, non-aesthetic nature.
