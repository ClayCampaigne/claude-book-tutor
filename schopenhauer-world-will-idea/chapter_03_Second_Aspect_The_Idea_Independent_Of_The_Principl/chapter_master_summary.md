<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Book III explains how the Platonic Ideas—the fixed, graded archetypes that are will’s adequate objectifications—can be known, and why art alone communicates them. Building on Books I–II, Schopenhauer aligns Plato and Kant: the sensible world is mere manifestation; true being expresses itself through it. Yet he separates three levels: (a) the thing‑in‑itself as will, utterly non‑objective; (b) the Idea, its direct, adequate objectification that still retains only the universal form “object-for-a-subject”; and (c) phenomena, the Idea broken into multiplicity by the principle of sufficient reason (space, time, causality). Ordinary and scientific cognition, serving the will, moves within relations under the PSR; remove relations and its objects vanish.

Access to Ideas occurs in rare, will‑less contemplation: the subject ceases to be individual, the object ceases to be particular, and the world as idea stands “complete and pure.” This moment grounds the felt unity with nature and loosens the sense of transience. Art arises from this state. Genius is the sustained capacity to become the pure subject of knowledge and to reproduce the intuited Idea in a medium; imagination aids but does not constitute genius. Hence the genius’s imprudence (hostile to PSR‑bound calculation) and the noted kinship with madness (both loosen the thread of relational knowledge), though genius clarifies whereas madness falsifies.

Aesthetic pleasure has a subjective pole (peace from freedom from willing) and an objective pole (grasp of the Idea). Beauty attains pure knowing effortlessly; the sublime attains it by consciously turning away from hostile relations (danger, immensity), culminating in the insight that the vast world exists only as our idea. Sight is preeminent; “charming” or disgusting contents re‑excite the will and spoil art.

Every thing can be beautiful as manifestation of an Idea; significance rises with the grade of objectification—from architecture and hydraulics (gravity, rigidity, fluidity) through landscape and animal art to human form and action. Human representation must unite species‑beauty with individual character; the Ideal is grasped a priori and cannot be built from copies. Sculpture chiefly renders beauty and grace; painting, character. Medium constraints solve the Laocoön problem: marble must not depict a cry. Historical painting is judged by real, intuitive significance, not nominal, conceptual labels; Dutch genre can equal “grand history,” while the highest works visibly embody will’s self‑suppression (Raphael, Correggio). The object of art is always the Idea, never the concept; hence imitators and allegory, which divert perception into abstraction, betray art’s end. Science traces the endless relations; art makes the vertical cut to essence.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Builds from Books I–II: The world as idea is the objectification of will in definite graded levels. These grades are the Platonic Ideas—the unchanging archetypal forms (of bodies and fundamental forces) expressed in countless individuals.
- Individuals multiply, appear, and perish only under the forms of the principle of sufficient reason (PSR: space, time, causality). The Platonic Idea lies outside the PSR; it has no multiplicity or change.
- Because our ordinary, individual cognition operates under the PSR, Ideas lie outside its scope; to know Ideas requires transcending the individuality of the knower. Explaining this exceptional access is the task of Book III.
- Schopenhauer aligns Kant and Plato: both treat the sensible world as mere manifestation and true being as that which expresses itself in it. Kant denies time, space, causality to the thing-in-itself; Plato implicitly denies them to Ideas by denying multiplicity and becoming.
- Reformulation: our forms make the one per kind appear as many in succession; transcendental knowledge can be obtained abstractly (Kant) and, exceptionally, intuitively (to be explained).
- Cautions against confusing Plato’s Ideas with Kant’s a priori forms: the latter limit us to phenomena; the former are what those limits exclude.
- Key distinction: Idea ≠ thing-in-itself; the Idea is the direct, adequate objectification of the thing-in-itself, which is will prior to objectification.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Distinction sharpened: Kant’s a priori forms (which limit knowledge to phenomena) are not Plato’s Ideas (which those forms exclude). Schopenhauer: the Idea is not the thing-in-itself but its direct, adequate objectification. The thing-in-itself is will, non-objective and outside all forms of knowing; Kant erred by not denying even the basic form “object-for-a-subject” to the thing-in-itself.
- The Platonic Idea retains only the most universal form of representation (object-for-subject) while shedding all subordinate forms expressed by the principle of sufficient reason (PSR: space, time, causality, grounds). The PSR multiplies and obscures the Idea into innumerable transient individuals; thus particular things are only indirect objectifications of will, mediated by the Idea.
- If individuality’s forms fell away, we would apprehend only timeless Ideas (a nunc stans). As individuals, however, cognition via the body imposes PSR; time is “the moving image of eternity.”
- Ordinary and scientific knowledge, serving will, tracks only relations (in space, time, causality, similarity, motives). Remove relations and such objects vanish for it.
- Exceptional transition: in pure, will-less contemplation (focusing on the what, without concepts or relational aims), the subject ceases to be individual and the object ceases to be a particular; the Idea is intuited, and the subject becomes the “pure subject of knowledge,” beyond PSR. Here object and subject are of equal weight; Ideas are the adequate objectification of will, while particulars are their PSR-multiplied shadows.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- In pure, will-less contemplation, subject and object “reciprocally penetrate” and distinction between them (and all PSR forms: time, space, causality, individuality) falls away. The Platonic Idea then appears as will’s adequate objectification; the world as idea is “complete and pure.”
- The will is the in-itself of both the Idea and the individual/particular; outside representation it is one and the same in knower and known. Multiplicity and difference arise only from the PSR’s form of appearance. Without idea/knowledge, nothing remains but blind will.
- In this state the contemplator recognizes himself as the condition/supporter of the objective world; nature is drawn into him. This grounds a felt unity with all things and undermines the sense of absolute transience.
- Deep insight requires distinguishing: (a) will (thing-in-itself), (b) Ideas (graded, adequate objectifications), and (c) their phenomenal, PSR-bound manifestations. Examples: cloud-shapes, brook eddies, and frost “flowers” are accidental; their essential forces/laws are the Idea. Likewise, human history’s events are incidental; the enduring “Idea of man” lies in capacities, passions, vices, and excellences recurring across individuals and ages.
- No true gain/loss occurs in phenomena; the source (will) is inexhaustible. The only event “in-itself” is will’s self-knowledge and its assertion or denial.
- Science (history via motives; natural science as etiology/morphology; mathematics of space/time) treats relations under the PSR. Art, by contrast, stems from genius: it intuits and communicates Ideas by isolating a particular as representative of the whole, suspending relations and time. Science is an endless horizontal line; art is the vertical cut that reaches the essential.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Science proceeds under the principle of sufficient reason (PSR), endlessly tracing relations; art, by contrast, isolates a particular from the flux and intuits in it the timeless Idea. Thus art’s “vertical cut” halts time and relations; it is valid for art, not for practical life or science.
- Genius is exceptional capacity for pure, will-less contemplation: forgetting self and interests, remaining the “pure subject of knowledge,” and holding this state long enough to reproduce the Idea in a medium. It reflects a surplus of cognitive power beyond the needs of individual will, becoming a clear mirror of the world’s inner nature. Hence the genius’s restlessness, dissatisfaction with the present, quest for lofty objects, and desire for like-minded company; ordinary people are content with the present and relations serving their will.
- Imagination is necessary but not identical to genius: it expands beyond limited, imperfect instances to grasp what nature aimed at but couldn’t realize amid conflicting forms. Without genius, imagination yields egocentric daydreaming and formulaic novels that please by identification.
- Ordinary cognition hastily subsumes to concepts and utility; genius lingers on life itself, often awkward in practical affairs. This difference shows in countenance: predominance of knowledge over will vs the reverse.
- Genius tends to shun mathematics and PSR-bound cognition (which ground prudence and science); conversely, skilled mathematicians often lack artistic susceptibility. Perceptual (intuitive) knowledge opposes abstract reason; geniuses may display strong emotions or “irrational” actions due to intense will-energy and the dominance of vivid intuitions over colorless concepts.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Prudence versus genius: prudence hinges on quick grasp of causal and motivational relations (PSR-bound). While one operates prudently, one is not a genius; while one operates as genius, one is not prudent.
- Intuitive (perceptual) knowledge opposes abstract, rational knowledge. In geniuses, vivid intuitions outshine concepts and, combined with powerful will-energy, can drive impulsive actions, strong present-focused emotions, indiscretion, object-centered speech, soliloquy, and “weaknesses” akin to madness.
- The long-noted kinship of genius and madness has an intellectual ground. Madness does not typically falsify present perception or basic reasoning; it disrupts memory’s continuity. Gaps are filled with fictions—either fixed ideas (monomania) or shifting fancies (folly)—so the present is misrelated to a false past. In severe cases memory collapses, leaving capricious behavior; unlike animals (no abstract past), the madman has an abstract but false past.
- Etiology: unbearable, enduring mental pain (in memory) can trigger madness as nature’s refuge by breaking memory’s thread and substituting fictions.
- Common point with genius: both set aside relational knowledge (PSR) to fix on what is immediately, intensely given; the genius elevates partial traits to the complete Idea, hence sees and acts in extremes, knows Ideas rather than individuals, and can be naïve in practical dealings.
- Definition: genius is the capacity to know Ideas independent of PSR and to become the pure subject of knowledge. This capacity exists in all (basis of aesthetic pleasure), but in geniuses it is stronger and sustained, enabling intentional reproduction of the grasped Idea in art. Art aids intuition by abstracting from accidents, letting us “see through the artist’s eyes”; innate intuition is paired with acquired technique. Next: the beautiful and the sublime in nature and art.
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Art as mediator of Ideas: Aesthetic pleasure is the same whether from nature or art; art facilitates grasping the Idea because the artist, having intuited the pure Idea, abstracts from accidental, PSR-bound relations and lets us “see with his eyes.” Genius (inborn power to know Ideas) is distinct from technique (acquired ability to communicate them).

- Structure of aesthetic contemplation (subjective side foregrounded):
  - Two inseparable components: (1) knowledge of the object as Platonic Idea (enduring form of a species), and (2) self-consciousness as the pure, will-less subject of knowledge.
  - Condition: suspension of PSR-governed, relation-focused cognition that serves the will and science.
  - The resulting pleasure varies by whether the subjective freedom from will or the objective grasp of the Idea predominates.

- Will versus aesthetic peace: Willing = endless lack, fleeting satisfactions, and suffering; consciousness dominated by desire/fear cannot find lasting happiness. In pure contemplation, knowledge is freed from will, time, and relations; one becomes the pure subject, and the particular becomes the Idea. This yields Epicurean “painlessness,” indifferent to fortune (prison/palace alike).

- Examples and mechanisms:
  - Dutch still lifes and Ruisdael’s modest landscapes model and transmit this will-less objectivity, calming the beholder.
  - Nature’s sudden beauty can momentarily deliver us from subjectivity; most people lack this objectivity, seeking only utility, hence solitude/nature feel “useless” and hostile to them.
  - Nostalgia’s charm: memory retains the objective scene but forgets past willing; the same relief is achievable in the present through pure contemplation, wherein the world as idea remains and the world as will vanishes.

- Preview: The sublime will be explained as a modification of this subjective state before turning to the objective achievements of art.

- On light and the senses: Light pleases because sight enables the purest, will-independent perception; other senses bind more directly to will (hearing somewhat; touch more; smell and taste most). Beauty of reflections in water stems from delight in pure knowing via the evident action of reflected light.
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Sensory hierarchy and subjective ground: Smell and taste are most bound to the will (thus “ignoble”/subjective senses). Sight, by contrast, is relatively will-free; pleasure in light—and especially in clear reflections on water—stems from delight in pure, will-less knowing, the subjective core of aesthetic enjoyment.

- Transition to the sublime: Beauty arises when objects readily present their Ideas and pure knowing prevails effortlessly. The sublime occurs when the same or similar objects stand in a hostile or overwhelming relation to the human will (danger, privation, immensity), yet the beholder consciously turns away from these relations and maintains will-less contemplation of the Idea.

- Key distinction: Beautiful = pure knowing without struggle; Sublime = pure knowing achieved and held by a conscious overcoming of the will’s adverse relation (while retaining a background awareness of will in general). If a particular fear/desire intrudes, the sublime collapses into anxiety.

- Degrees/examples:
  - Faint: winter light that illuminates without warming; vast, silent, empty landscapes (test of capacity for pure contemplation).
  - Stronger: lifeless deserts, naked rocks; nature’s convulsions—storms, cliffs, torrents.
  - Highest (dynamical sublime): tempestuous sea and thunder—twofold consciousness becomes explicit: the frail individual (phenomenon of will) versus the eternal, peaceful pure subject, for whom the tumult is “only idea.”
  - Mathematical sublime: sheer spatial/temporal immensity diminishes the individual; resolved by recognizing all worlds as our idea, grounded in the pure knowing subject. Schopenhauer adopts Kant’s labels (dynamical/mathematical) but rejects Kant’s moral explanation.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Mathematical sublime: Confronting spatial/temporal immensity (night sky, vast ages) first diminishes the individual (phenomenon of will) to “nothing,” but is then countered by the felt awareness that all such worlds exist only as our idea—modifications of the pure knowing subject. This dependence of the vast upon the knowing subject reverses the initial oppression into exaltation, a unity with the world (echoed in the Upanishads). The effect is strongest in directly perceived, bounded vast spaces (e.g., immense domes), where the whole extent is sensibly present; the starry vault works similarly by apparent, not real, extent. Temporal immensity (very old mountains, pyramids, colossal ruins) also produces it.

- Sublime character (ethical analogue): will remains unexcited where it normally would; knowledge rules. Traits: objective regard for others’ faults, injustice, or happiness without hate/envy; recognition of beauty without desire; equanimity toward fortune; viewing one’s life under the Idea of humanity rather than personal fate.

- Opposite: the “charming/attractive” = direct excitation of will that destroys pure contemplation. Two artistic forms are condemned:
  - Positive: deceptive still lifes that stimulate appetite (prepared foods, drinks); simple fruit may pass as nature’s form/color.
  - In history/sculpture: nudity posed to arouse passion (the ancients largely avoid this via objective ideality).
  - A negative variant—disgust/loathsomeness—also excites will (aversion) and is inadmissible; mere ugliness (non-disgusting) can be allowable.

- Beautiful vs sublime (subjective distinction): both require pure, will-less knowing of the Idea; beauty attains it effortlessly, the sublime by consciously turning away from hostile relations to the will. Objectively they do not differ: in both, the object is the Platonic Idea (adequate objectification of will), correlative to the pure subject; both lie outside the PSR, so time and even space distinctions vanish in aesthetic intuition (e.g., “this” tree vs any).

- Universality and degrees of beauty: everything can be beautiful insofar as it allows pure objective contemplation and manifests an Idea. Things are “more beautiful” when they:
  - Express their species’ Idea clearly and completely, easing the transition from individual to Idea; or
  - Embody a higher grade of will’s objectivity (human form/action highest: focus of plastic art and poetry).
  - Even unorganised and artificial things carry lower-grade Ideas (gravity, rigidity, fluidity, light), voiced in rocks, waters, buildings. Architecture and landscape-gardening can aid these Ideas to show purely; bad designs hinder but cannot erase them.
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Extending beauty to all things: Not only organisms but also unorganized nature and even manufactured items can be aesthetically contemplated because they manifest the lowest-grade Ideas (gravity, rigidity, fluidity, light). Landscape-gardening and architecture can aid these Ideas to appear purely; poor designs hinder but cannot erase them.

- Manufactured articles express the Idea of their material, not an “Idea of chair/table.” In scholastic terms: they show the forma substantialis (grade of will’s objectification in the material), not the forma accidentalis (the human-conceived artifact form). Schopenhauer aligns with Platonists who deny Ideas of artifacts; he also criticizes Plato’s view that art imitates particulars (not Ideas), tracing Plato’s rejection of art to this error.

- Aesthetic pleasure has two foci: will-less peace predominates with low-grade Ideas (inorganic, plants, architecture); comprehension of rich, higher Ideas predominates with animals/humans (violence, satisfaction, aberration, and in Christian art, will’s change and self-surrender; drama/historical painting portray will enlightened by knowledge).

- Matter as such cannot express an Idea (it is causality, hence PSR-bound); only its perceivable qualities (gravity, cohesion, light-sensitivity) are weak objectifications accessible to intuition.

- Architecture (as pure art, abstracted from utility) makes distinct the conflict of gravity and rigidity—the “bass notes” of nature—by forcing these forces into indirect satisfactions (columns bear roofs; arches push through pillars), rendering their struggle visible. Beauty lies in the necessary adaptation of each part to the whole’s stability; forms are determined by structural ends (round columns simplest; twisted columns tasteless). Material truth is essential: discovering lighter/wooden/mixed unseen materials diminishes or ruins the effect, showing architecture affects us dynamically (forces), not merely mathematically (symmetry). Symmetry/regularity aid comprehension but are secondary; ruins can still be beautiful.

- Architecture has a special relation to light: it is enhanced by sun/moonlight, and good siting considers light/climate; beyond illumination, architecture can reveal light’s nature.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Architecture’s aesthetic means and limits:
  - Regularity and symmetry aid stability, comprehension, and disclose space’s constitution, but are secondary; even ruins can be beautiful.
  - Architecture is uniquely tied to light: massive, sharply contoured forms intercept and reflect it, revealing light’s nature. Light delights as the condition of the purest perception.
  - Because it manifests the lowest Ideas (gravity, rigidity), architecture’s pleasure is chiefly subjective: it frees the beholder into will-less, pure contemplation. At the opposite extreme, drama presents the most significant Ideas; its pleasure is predominantly objective.
  - Unlike plastic art/poetry (copies), architecture presents the thing itself, helping the actual object express its Idea.
  - Architectural beauty is constrained by utility and climate. Mild climates (India, Egypt, Greece, Rome) allowed freer aesthetic pursuit; in the North, functional demands (steep roofs, towers) narrow aesthetic scope, prompting Gothic’s reliance on sculptural ornament. Utility also sustains architecture as a profession.

- A sister art without utility: artistic hydraulics (fountains, cascades, lakes) reveals gravity in fluidity (mobility, transparency), paralleling architecture’s revelation of gravity in rigidity; rare practical overlap (e.g., Trevi Fountain).

- Vegetal and landscape arts:
  - Landscape-gardening can only assist nature; true mastery lies in landscape painting, where still lifes/ruins chiefly induce subjective peace (seeing through the painter’s will-less eye). As richer Ideas appear (vegetal landscapes), the objective side rises.

- Animal art:
  - Animal painting/sculpture disclose higher Ideas; objective interest dominates as we behold our own will manifesting naïvely, without intellect’s restraint, in species-character (form, action, mien), not individual character. Direct contemplative observation teaches nature’s “signatures”; many forms are adaptations—variations on one theme. Formula for their inner nature: “Tat tvam asi” (this living thing art thou).

- Human art (historical painting/sculpture):
  - Task: present the Idea at will’s highest grade. In animals, the characteristic equals the beautiful (no individual character). In humans, species-character (beauty) and individual character must be united in one figure.
  - Human beauty = complete sensible expression of the Idea of man; it swiftly lifts us into pure, will-less knowing (hence its powerful consolation).
  - Natural production of beauty: at this grade the will overcomes lower-grade resistances; harmonious subordination and coordination of many “vitae propriae” (parts) yield the rare result of beauty.
  - Artistic method cannot be mere imitation or collage of “best parts”; without a prior intuitive grasp of beauty (the Idea), selection is blind—hence historic failures (e.g., old German nudes).
</CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>
- Beauty in human form arises when all parts (each with its own vita propria) are perfectly subordinated to the whole and coordinated harmoniously—nothing superfluous or constrained—yielding the fully expressed species-character.

- Art cannot reach beauty by copying particular nature or by assembling “best parts.” Recognition and creation of beauty require an a priori anticipation of the Idea (the “Ideal”), distinct from the PSR’s a priori forms. This anticipation concerns the content (the what) of phenomena, not their relational form (the how).

- Ground: because artist and critic are themselves will (nature’s in-itself), “like knows like”; genius “hears” nature’s stammered intention and articulates the Idea clearly, surpassing nature (Greek canon as paradigm). Experience supplies models to bring the dim a priori grasp to clear representation.

- Definitions:
  - Beauty (objective): adequate objectification of will in a merely spatial phenomenon; paradigmatic in plants.
  - Grace: adequate objectification of will in time—movements/positions that express the act of will with perfect ease, appropriateness, and no excess; presupposes proportional, harmonious form. Plants lack grace; animals and humans can possess both.

- Human representation must unite species beauty with individual character idealized as a distinctive side of the Idea of humanity. Excess of individual character → caricature; excess of species-character → emptiness. Antiquity presents varied idealizations (Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, Antinous; down to Silenus/Faun). Grace must not be sacrificed to character; otherwise grimace/distortion.

- Mediums:
  - Sculpture: chiefly beauty and grace; beauty benefits from multiple viewpoints.
  - Painting: chiefly character (expression via countenance, gesture, eyes, color); character is best grasped from a single viewpoint.

- Laocoön debate setup: Winckelmann explains the silence stoically; Lessing replaces with the aesthetic claim that beauty forbids a cry and adds a ban on transient states—Schopenhauer notes many excellent sculptures fix transitory motions; Goethe even deems such choice necessary. Further analysis follows.
</CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>
- Laocoön debate resolved by medium-specific limits: Regardless of whether Laocoön “would” cry, sculpture must not depict a shriek. Shrieking’s essence is sound; marble can only show an open, distorted mouth—means without the audible end—spoiling beauty and expression and rendering a ridiculous, ineffectual effort. Poetry and theater may (and should) include cries (Virgil, Homer; Sophocles’ Philoctetes; Kemble) because sound completes the expression; painting/music motifs are admissible only when they don’t require violent motion or mouth distortion (e.g., St. Cecilia). Thus Winckelmann’s description of nonverbal pain stands once the Stoic rationale is dropped; Lessing’s “beauty forbids cries” was close but missed the medium argument.

- Sculpture’s aim (beauty with grace) explains its love of nudity; drapery should function not to cover but to reveal form by suggestive indication, akin to foreshortening in painting—compelling the understanding to perceive the hidden cause (body) from its visible effect (folds). Rhetorical analogy: clear, simple expression is like near-nudity; pompous obscurity is gaudy concealment.

- Historical painting adds “character” (will at its highest objectification in representative individuals acting). Art concerns inward significance (insight into the Idea of humanity) rather than outward, historical significance (effects in the world under the PSR). Hence:
  - Genre scenes can equal or surpass “grand history” in inward significance; Dutch masters are unjustly slighted.
  - Distinguish nominal (conceptual, historical label/costume) from real significance (what is actually intuited: the universal Idea). “Moses found” really shows a foundling rescued by a noble lady.
  - Historical subjects have no intrinsic advantage; choose only those whose essential point is sensibly representable, not merely thinkable, else the conceptual “nominal” overwhelms perception.
  - Historical themes can be disadvantageous if they confine artists to fields poor in pictorial/essential content (Schopenhauer cites Jewish history as an example).
</CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>
- Historical subjects: The genuinely artistic view fixes on the universal (the Idea) expressible to perception, not on particular, merely “nominal” historical details. Choose only subjects whose chief point can be sensibly shown, not inferred; otherwise abstract thought overwhelms perception (analogous to staging key action offstage). Historical themes are disadvantageous when imposed for non-artistic reasons and poor in pictorial/significant content; Schopenhauer deems much Judeo‑Christian history ill-suited. Exception: works that perceptibly embody Christianity’s ethical spirit (groups of saints, Madonna and Child, etc.)—not events but faces/eyes expressing perfect knowledge of Ideas that quiets the will into resignation. These, achieved supremely by Raphael and Correggio (early), mark art’s summit: representation of will’s free self-suppression.

- Core doctrine: The object of art is the Platonic Idea, never the particular or the concept. Concept: abstract, discursive, communicable, exhausted by definition (unitas post rem), a “dead receptacle.” Idea: perceptual, fully determinate, grasped only by the pure subject (genius), conditionally communicable, a “living organism” (unitas ante rem) that yields fresh insight.

- Artist vs imitator: The genius works from immediate intuition (“feeling”), not concepts; imitators derive formulas from concepts (mannerism), pleasing the age but aging quickly. True works, drawn directly from life/nature, are timeless and recognized slowly by rare competent judges; praise of posterity often costs contemporary acclaim.

- Allegory rejected: It makes a work mean something other than it shows, thereby signifying a concept and diverting the mind from perception to abstraction (better done by books). Hence allegory misses art’s end—the direct presentation of the Idea.
</CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>
- The Idea is directly and fully perceptible; anything that cannot be made object of perception is a concept. Allegory, by definition, makes a work mean something other than what it shows, thus signifies a concept and diverts the beholder from intuitive perception to abstraction—contrary to art’s end.
- In allegory the goal is reached as soon as one “gets what it stands for,” after which attention leaves the perceptual content. Hence allegories in visual arts function like hieroglyphics; whatever artistic value they possess belongs to them not as allegories but as depictions.
- Reapplies the “nominal vs real significance” distinction: nominal = the allegorical label (e.g., “Genius of Fame”); real = what is actually seen (a beautiful winged youth and boys), which alone expresses an Idea. Turning to the nominal is a fall from Idea to concept and can even falsify perception (e.g., Correggio’s Night uses impossible light for an allegorical motive).
- Such works serve two ends (concept and Idea); only the latter is proper to art. Allegory is likened to mixing art with utility (statues as candelabra/caryatids), which true connoisseurs reject.
- Any emotional impact of allegory stems from abstract thought and could be matched by a written legend (“fame,” “Le temps découvre la vérité”), confirming allegory’s discursive, non-aesthetic nature.
