- Mathematical sublime: Confronting spatial/temporal immensity (night sky, vast ages) first diminishes the individual (phenomenon of will) to “nothing,” but is then countered by the felt awareness that all such worlds exist only as our idea—modifications of the pure knowing subject. This dependence of the vast upon the knowing subject reverses the initial oppression into exaltation, a unity with the world (echoed in the Upanishads). The effect is strongest in directly perceived, bounded vast spaces (e.g., immense domes), where the whole extent is sensibly present; the starry vault works similarly by apparent, not real, extent. Temporal immensity (very old mountains, pyramids, colossal ruins) also produces it.

- Sublime character (ethical analogue): will remains unexcited where it normally would; knowledge rules. Traits: objective regard for others’ faults, injustice, or happiness without hate/envy; recognition of beauty without desire; equanimity toward fortune; viewing one’s life under the Idea of humanity rather than personal fate.

- Opposite: the “charming/attractive” = direct excitation of will that destroys pure contemplation. Two artistic forms are condemned:
  - Positive: deceptive still lifes that stimulate appetite (prepared foods, drinks); simple fruit may pass as nature’s form/color.
  - In history/sculpture: nudity posed to arouse passion (the ancients largely avoid this via objective ideality).
  - A negative variant—disgust/loathsomeness—also excites will (aversion) and is inadmissible; mere ugliness (non-disgusting) can be allowable.

- Beautiful vs sublime (subjective distinction): both require pure, will-less knowing of the Idea; beauty attains it effortlessly, the sublime by consciously turning away from hostile relations to the will. Objectively they do not differ: in both, the object is the Platonic Idea (adequate objectification of will), correlative to the pure subject; both lie outside the PSR, so time and even space distinctions vanish in aesthetic intuition (e.g., “this” tree vs any).

- Universality and degrees of beauty: everything can be beautiful insofar as it allows pure objective contemplation and manifests an Idea. Things are “more beautiful” when they:
  - Express their species’ Idea clearly and completely, easing the transition from individual to Idea; or
  - Embody a higher grade of will’s objectivity (human form/action highest: focus of plastic art and poetry).
  - Even unorganised and artificial things carry lower-grade Ideas (gravity, rigidity, fluidity, light), voiced in rocks, waters, buildings. Architecture and landscape-gardening can aid these Ideas to show purely; bad designs hinder but cannot erase them.
