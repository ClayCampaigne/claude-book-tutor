- Historical subjects: The genuinely artistic view fixes on the universal (the Idea) expressible to perception, not on particular, merely “nominal” historical details. Choose only subjects whose chief point can be sensibly shown, not inferred; otherwise abstract thought overwhelms perception (analogous to staging key action offstage). Historical themes are disadvantageous when imposed for non-artistic reasons and poor in pictorial/significant content; Schopenhauer deems much Judeo‑Christian history ill-suited. Exception: works that perceptibly embody Christianity’s ethical spirit (groups of saints, Madonna and Child, etc.)—not events but faces/eyes expressing perfect knowledge of Ideas that quiets the will into resignation. These, achieved supremely by Raphael and Correggio (early), mark art’s summit: representation of will’s free self-suppression.

- Core doctrine: The object of art is the Platonic Idea, never the particular or the concept. Concept: abstract, discursive, communicable, exhausted by definition (unitas post rem), a “dead receptacle.” Idea: perceptual, fully determinate, grasped only by the pure subject (genius), conditionally communicable, a “living organism” (unitas ante rem) that yields fresh insight.

- Artist vs imitator: The genius works from immediate intuition (“feeling”), not concepts; imitators derive formulas from concepts (mannerism), pleasing the age but aging quickly. True works, drawn directly from life/nature, are timeless and recognized slowly by rare competent judges; praise of posterity often costs contemporary acclaim.

- Allegory rejected: It makes a work mean something other than it shows, thereby signifying a concept and diverting the mind from perception to abstraction (better done by books). Hence allegory misses art’s end—the direct presentation of the Idea.
