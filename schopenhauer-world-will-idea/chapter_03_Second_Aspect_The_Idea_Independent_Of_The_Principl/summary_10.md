- Architecture’s aesthetic means and limits:
  - Regularity and symmetry aid stability, comprehension, and disclose space’s constitution, but are secondary; even ruins can be beautiful.
  - Architecture is uniquely tied to light: massive, sharply contoured forms intercept and reflect it, revealing light’s nature. Light delights as the condition of the purest perception.
  - Because it manifests the lowest Ideas (gravity, rigidity), architecture’s pleasure is chiefly subjective: it frees the beholder into will-less, pure contemplation. At the opposite extreme, drama presents the most significant Ideas; its pleasure is predominantly objective.
  - Unlike plastic art/poetry (copies), architecture presents the thing itself, helping the actual object express its Idea.
  - Architectural beauty is constrained by utility and climate. Mild climates (India, Egypt, Greece, Rome) allowed freer aesthetic pursuit; in the North, functional demands (steep roofs, towers) narrow aesthetic scope, prompting Gothic’s reliance on sculptural ornament. Utility also sustains architecture as a profession.

- A sister art without utility: artistic hydraulics (fountains, cascades, lakes) reveals gravity in fluidity (mobility, transparency), paralleling architecture’s revelation of gravity in rigidity; rare practical overlap (e.g., Trevi Fountain).

- Vegetal and landscape arts:
  - Landscape-gardening can only assist nature; true mastery lies in landscape painting, where still lifes/ruins chiefly induce subjective peace (seeing through the painter’s will-less eye). As richer Ideas appear (vegetal landscapes), the objective side rises.

- Animal art:
  - Animal painting/sculpture disclose higher Ideas; objective interest dominates as we behold our own will manifesting naïvely, without intellect’s restraint, in species-character (form, action, mien), not individual character. Direct contemplative observation teaches nature’s “signatures”; many forms are adaptations—variations on one theme. Formula for their inner nature: “Tat tvam asi” (this living thing art thou).

- Human art (historical painting/sculpture):
  - Task: present the Idea at will’s highest grade. In animals, the characteristic equals the beautiful (no individual character). In humans, species-character (beauty) and individual character must be united in one figure.
  - Human beauty = complete sensible expression of the Idea of man; it swiftly lifts us into pure, will-less knowing (hence its powerful consolation).
  - Natural production of beauty: at this grade the will overcomes lower-grade resistances; harmonious subordination and coordination of many “vitae propriae” (parts) yield the rare result of beauty.
  - Artistic method cannot be mere imitation or collage of “best parts”; without a prior intuitive grasp of beauty (the Idea), selection is blind—hence historic failures (e.g., old German nudes).
