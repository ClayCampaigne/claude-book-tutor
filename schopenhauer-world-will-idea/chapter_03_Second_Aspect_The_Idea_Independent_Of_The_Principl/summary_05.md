- Prudence versus genius: prudence hinges on quick grasp of causal and motivational relations (PSR-bound). While one operates prudently, one is not a genius; while one operates as genius, one is not prudent.
- Intuitive (perceptual) knowledge opposes abstract, rational knowledge. In geniuses, vivid intuitions outshine concepts and, combined with powerful will-energy, can drive impulsive actions, strong present-focused emotions, indiscretion, object-centered speech, soliloquy, and “weaknesses” akin to madness.
- The long-noted kinship of genius and madness has an intellectual ground. Madness does not typically falsify present perception or basic reasoning; it disrupts memory’s continuity. Gaps are filled with fictions—either fixed ideas (monomania) or shifting fancies (folly)—so the present is misrelated to a false past. In severe cases memory collapses, leaving capricious behavior; unlike animals (no abstract past), the madman has an abstract but false past.
- Etiology: unbearable, enduring mental pain (in memory) can trigger madness as nature’s refuge by breaking memory’s thread and substituting fictions.
- Common point with genius: both set aside relational knowledge (PSR) to fix on what is immediately, intensely given; the genius elevates partial traits to the complete Idea, hence sees and acts in extremes, knows Ideas rather than individuals, and can be naïve in practical dealings.
- Definition: genius is the capacity to know Ideas independent of PSR and to become the pure subject of knowledge. This capacity exists in all (basis of aesthetic pleasure), but in geniuses it is stronger and sustained, enabling intentional reproduction of the grasped Idea in art. Art aids intuition by abstracting from accidents, letting us “see through the artist’s eyes”; innate intuition is paired with acquired technique. Next: the beautiful and the sublime in nature and art.
