- Distinction sharpened: Kant’s a priori forms (which limit knowledge to phenomena) are not Plato’s Ideas (which those forms exclude). Schopenhauer: the Idea is not the thing-in-itself but its direct, adequate objectification. The thing-in-itself is will, non-objective and outside all forms of knowing; Kant erred by not denying even the basic form “object-for-a-subject” to the thing-in-itself.
- The Platonic Idea retains only the most universal form of representation (object-for-subject) while shedding all subordinate forms expressed by the principle of sufficient reason (PSR: space, time, causality, grounds). The PSR multiplies and obscures the Idea into innumerable transient individuals; thus particular things are only indirect objectifications of will, mediated by the Idea.
- If individuality’s forms fell away, we would apprehend only timeless Ideas (a nunc stans). As individuals, however, cognition via the body imposes PSR; time is “the moving image of eternity.”
- Ordinary and scientific knowledge, serving will, tracks only relations (in space, time, causality, similarity, motives). Remove relations and such objects vanish for it.
- Exceptional transition: in pure, will-less contemplation (focusing on the what, without concepts or relational aims), the subject ceases to be individual and the object ceases to be a particular; the Idea is intuited, and the subject becomes the “pure subject of knowledge,” beyond PSR. Here object and subject are of equal weight; Ideas are the adequate objectification of will, while particulars are their PSR-multiplied shadows.
