- Sensory hierarchy and subjective ground: Smell and taste are most bound to the will (thus “ignoble”/subjective senses). Sight, by contrast, is relatively will-free; pleasure in light—and especially in clear reflections on water—stems from delight in pure, will-less knowing, the subjective core of aesthetic enjoyment.

- Transition to the sublime: Beauty arises when objects readily present their Ideas and pure knowing prevails effortlessly. The sublime occurs when the same or similar objects stand in a hostile or overwhelming relation to the human will (danger, privation, immensity), yet the beholder consciously turns away from these relations and maintains will-less contemplation of the Idea.

- Key distinction: Beautiful = pure knowing without struggle; Sublime = pure knowing achieved and held by a conscious overcoming of the will’s adverse relation (while retaining a background awareness of will in general). If a particular fear/desire intrudes, the sublime collapses into anxiety.

- Degrees/examples:
  - Faint: winter light that illuminates without warming; vast, silent, empty landscapes (test of capacity for pure contemplation).
  - Stronger: lifeless deserts, naked rocks; nature’s convulsions—storms, cliffs, torrents.
  - Highest (dynamical sublime): tempestuous sea and thunder—twofold consciousness becomes explicit: the frail individual (phenomenon of will) versus the eternal, peaceful pure subject, for whom the tumult is “only idea.”
  - Mathematical sublime: sheer spatial/temporal immensity diminishes the individual; resolved by recognizing all worlds as our idea, grounded in the pure knowing subject. Schopenhauer adopts Kant’s labels (dynamical/mathematical) but rejects Kant’s moral explanation.
