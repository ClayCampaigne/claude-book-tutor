- Beauty in human form arises when all parts (each with its own vita propria) are perfectly subordinated to the whole and coordinated harmoniously—nothing superfluous or constrained—yielding the fully expressed species-character.

- Art cannot reach beauty by copying particular nature or by assembling “best parts.” Recognition and creation of beauty require an a priori anticipation of the Idea (the “Ideal”), distinct from the PSR’s a priori forms. This anticipation concerns the content (the what) of phenomena, not their relational form (the how).

- Ground: because artist and critic are themselves will (nature’s in-itself), “like knows like”; genius “hears” nature’s stammered intention and articulates the Idea clearly, surpassing nature (Greek canon as paradigm). Experience supplies models to bring the dim a priori grasp to clear representation.

- Definitions:
  - Beauty (objective): adequate objectification of will in a merely spatial phenomenon; paradigmatic in plants.
  - Grace: adequate objectification of will in time—movements/positions that express the act of will with perfect ease, appropriateness, and no excess; presupposes proportional, harmonious form. Plants lack grace; animals and humans can possess both.

- Human representation must unite species beauty with individual character idealized as a distinctive side of the Idea of humanity. Excess of individual character → caricature; excess of species-character → emptiness. Antiquity presents varied idealizations (Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, Antinous; down to Silenus/Faun). Grace must not be sacrificed to character; otherwise grimace/distortion.

- Mediums:
  - Sculpture: chiefly beauty and grace; beauty benefits from multiple viewpoints.
  - Painting: chiefly character (expression via countenance, gesture, eyes, color); character is best grasped from a single viewpoint.

- Laocoön debate setup: Winckelmann explains the silence stoically; Lessing replaces with the aesthetic claim that beauty forbids a cry and adds a ban on transient states—Schopenhauer notes many excellent sculptures fix transitory motions; Goethe even deems such choice necessary. Further analysis follows.
