- Laocoön debate resolved by medium-specific limits: Regardless of whether Laocoön “would” cry, sculpture must not depict a shriek. Shrieking’s essence is sound; marble can only show an open, distorted mouth—means without the audible end—spoiling beauty and expression and rendering a ridiculous, ineffectual effort. Poetry and theater may (and should) include cries (Virgil, Homer; Sophocles’ Philoctetes; Kemble) because sound completes the expression; painting/music motifs are admissible only when they don’t require violent motion or mouth distortion (e.g., St. Cecilia). Thus Winckelmann’s description of nonverbal pain stands once the Stoic rationale is dropped; Lessing’s “beauty forbids cries” was close but missed the medium argument.

- Sculpture’s aim (beauty with grace) explains its love of nudity; drapery should function not to cover but to reveal form by suggestive indication, akin to foreshortening in painting—compelling the understanding to perceive the hidden cause (body) from its visible effect (folds). Rhetorical analogy: clear, simple expression is like near-nudity; pompous obscurity is gaudy concealment.

- Historical painting adds “character” (will at its highest objectification in representative individuals acting). Art concerns inward significance (insight into the Idea of humanity) rather than outward, historical significance (effects in the world under the PSR). Hence:
  - Genre scenes can equal or surpass “grand history” in inward significance; Dutch masters are unjustly slighted.
  - Distinguish nominal (conceptual, historical label/costume) from real significance (what is actually intuited: the universal Idea). “Moses found” really shows a foundling rescued by a noble lady.
  - Historical subjects have no intrinsic advantage; choose only those whose essential point is sensibly representable, not merely thinkable, else the conceptual “nominal” overwhelms perception.
  - Historical themes can be disadvantageous if they confine artists to fields poor in pictorial/essential content (Schopenhauer cites Jewish history as an example).
