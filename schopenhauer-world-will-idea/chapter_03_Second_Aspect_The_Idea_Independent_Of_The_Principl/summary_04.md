- Science proceeds under the principle of sufficient reason (PSR), endlessly tracing relations; art, by contrast, isolates a particular from the flux and intuits in it the timeless Idea. Thus art’s “vertical cut” halts time and relations; it is valid for art, not for practical life or science.
- Genius is exceptional capacity for pure, will-less contemplation: forgetting self and interests, remaining the “pure subject of knowledge,” and holding this state long enough to reproduce the Idea in a medium. It reflects a surplus of cognitive power beyond the needs of individual will, becoming a clear mirror of the world’s inner nature. Hence the genius’s restlessness, dissatisfaction with the present, quest for lofty objects, and desire for like-minded company; ordinary people are content with the present and relations serving their will.
- Imagination is necessary but not identical to genius: it expands beyond limited, imperfect instances to grasp what nature aimed at but couldn’t realize amid conflicting forms. Without genius, imagination yields egocentric daydreaming and formulaic novels that please by identification.
- Ordinary cognition hastily subsumes to concepts and utility; genius lingers on life itself, often awkward in practical affairs. This difference shows in countenance: predominance of knowledge over will vs the reverse.
- Genius tends to shun mathematics and PSR-bound cognition (which ground prudence and science); conversely, skilled mathematicians often lack artistic susceptibility. Perceptual (intuitive) knowledge opposes abstract reason; geniuses may display strong emotions or “irrational” actions due to intense will-energy and the dominance of vivid intuitions over colorless concepts.
