- Art as mediator of Ideas: Aesthetic pleasure is the same whether from nature or art; art facilitates grasping the Idea because the artist, having intuited the pure Idea, abstracts from accidental, PSR-bound relations and lets us “see with his eyes.” Genius (inborn power to know Ideas) is distinct from technique (acquired ability to communicate them).

- Structure of aesthetic contemplation (subjective side foregrounded):
  - Two inseparable components: (1) knowledge of the object as Platonic Idea (enduring form of a species), and (2) self-consciousness as the pure, will-less subject of knowledge.
  - Condition: suspension of PSR-governed, relation-focused cognition that serves the will and science.
  - The resulting pleasure varies by whether the subjective freedom from will or the objective grasp of the Idea predominates.

- Will versus aesthetic peace: Willing = endless lack, fleeting satisfactions, and suffering; consciousness dominated by desire/fear cannot find lasting happiness. In pure contemplation, knowledge is freed from will, time, and relations; one becomes the pure subject, and the particular becomes the Idea. This yields Epicurean “painlessness,” indifferent to fortune (prison/palace alike).

- Examples and mechanisms:
  - Dutch still lifes and Ruisdael’s modest landscapes model and transmit this will-less objectivity, calming the beholder.
  - Nature’s sudden beauty can momentarily deliver us from subjectivity; most people lack this objectivity, seeking only utility, hence solitude/nature feel “useless” and hostile to them.
  - Nostalgia’s charm: memory retains the objective scene but forgets past willing; the same relief is achievable in the present through pure contemplation, wherein the world as idea remains and the world as will vanishes.

- Preview: The sublime will be explained as a modification of this subjective state before turning to the objective achievements of art.

- On light and the senses: Light pleases because sight enables the purest, will-independent perception; other senses bind more directly to will (hearing somewhat; touch more; smell and taste most). Beauty of reflections in water stems from delight in pure knowing via the evident action of reflected light.
