- In pure, will-less contemplation, subject and object “reciprocally penetrate” and distinction between them (and all PSR forms: time, space, causality, individuality) falls away. The Platonic Idea then appears as will’s adequate objectification; the world as idea is “complete and pure.”
- The will is the in-itself of both the Idea and the individual/particular; outside representation it is one and the same in knower and known. Multiplicity and difference arise only from the PSR’s form of appearance. Without idea/knowledge, nothing remains but blind will.
- In this state the contemplator recognizes himself as the condition/supporter of the objective world; nature is drawn into him. This grounds a felt unity with all things and undermines the sense of absolute transience.
- Deep insight requires distinguishing: (a) will (thing-in-itself), (b) Ideas (graded, adequate objectifications), and (c) their phenomenal, PSR-bound manifestations. Examples: cloud-shapes, brook eddies, and frost “flowers” are accidental; their essential forces/laws are the Idea. Likewise, human history’s events are incidental; the enduring “Idea of man” lies in capacities, passions, vices, and excellences recurring across individuals and ages.
- No true gain/loss occurs in phenomena; the source (will) is inexhaustible. The only event “in-itself” is will’s self-knowledge and its assertion or denial.
- Science (history via motives; natural science as etiology/morphology; mathematics of space/time) treats relations under the PSR. Art, by contrast, stems from genius: it intuits and communicates Ideas by isolating a particular as representative of the whole, suspending relations and time. Science is an endless horizontal line; art is the vertical cut that reaches the essential.
