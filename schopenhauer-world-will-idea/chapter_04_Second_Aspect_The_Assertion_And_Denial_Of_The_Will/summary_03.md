- Nature’s voice grounds our everyday fearlessness about death: animals live untroubled, and humans, though abstractly certain of death, rarely integrate it into “living” consciousness. This pervasive confidence arises from an inward awareness that we are Nature/the world itself; mere psychological appeals to habit are insufficient.
- Hence widespread doctrines of personal immortality persist despite weak evidence. Schopenhauer distinguishes his view: the will (thing‑in‑itself) and the pure knowing subject lie outside time; permanence and transience apply only to phenomena. Individually we perish as appearances, but as thing‑in‑itself we are the same will in all; death abolishes the illusion isolating our consciousness—this, not endless duration, is “immortality.”
- Fear of death targets the end of the individual, not pain. Reason can mitigate this by shifting to the universal standpoint: one who gladly affirms life could face death indifferently, assured that life and the present are secure to the will (Gita’s Arjuna; Goethe’s Prometheus; kinship with Bruno/Spinoza).
- Assertion vs denial of the will arise from “living” insight, not abstract doctrine: assertion wills life knowingly; denial occurs when insight quiets and suppresses willing. Philosophy can only describe, not prescribe; the will has no law.
- §55: Double aspect—phenomena are strictly necessary under the PSR; the will, as thing‑in‑itself, lies outside the PSR and is free.
