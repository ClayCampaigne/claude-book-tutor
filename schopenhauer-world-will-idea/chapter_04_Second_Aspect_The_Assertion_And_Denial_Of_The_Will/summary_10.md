- Extending the “fixed quota” hypothesis: At any time a person’s capacity for suffering is subjectively set. A dominant external “chief care” merely concentrates pain that would otherwise disperse across many petty annoyances; once it vanishes, latent material instantly swells to occupy the vacant “throne” of care, even if objectively lighter.

- Excessive joy and acute grief typically occur in the same highly active minds and arise less from what is present than from anticipations of the future. Because pain belongs essentially to life and its degree is fixed by the subject’s nature, sudden external changes cannot truly alter its overall measure.

- Hence immoderate joy and grief rest on delusion: joy presumes a lasting satisfaction life cannot provide; its collapse produces a proportional fall into pain. Both extremes can be avoided by knowledge that surveys things as a whole, resists wishful coloring, and recognizes the inevitability of renewed lack.

- This is the Stoic ideal: freeing the mind from such illusions to achieve stable equanimity—a stance exemplified by Horace’s counsel—prefiguring Schopenhauer’s call for insight-led moderation of affect.
