<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Book IV turns to human action without abandoning philosophy’s purely theoretical task. Philosophy explains what is; it neither legislates duties nor produces virtue—no more than aesthetics makes artists. Hence Schopenhauer rejects an “absolute ought” or a “law of freedom”: in his system the will is truly autonomous and almighty, determining both the world and our deeds as its self-knowledge. The guiding method is immanent: do not misuse the principle of sufficient reason (PSR) to chase “absolutes” or cosmogonies; genuine inquiry asks what the inner nature is and knows the Ideas beyond the PSR’s relations. From the same insight spring art and the disposition that can end in holiness.

§54 recaps: the world as idea is the mirror of will; in man, representation unifies action. Will is blind striving that, through representation, knows it wills life; “will to live” is pleonastic. Birth and death belong to phenomena under space, time, causality, and individuation; as thing‑in‑itself, will and the pure subject lie outside them. Generation and death mutually neutralize; nature cares for the species (Idea), not individuals. Life is ceaseless change of matter with form’s persistence; only the present is truly real, the meeting point of time‑bound object and timeless subject. Fear of death as loss of the present is illusory. Personal immortality is a chimera; what endures is the will itself, identical in all.

§55: Phenomena are strictly necessary under the PSR; the will, as thing‑in‑itself, is “free” only negatively (non‑necessitated). Human action issues necessarily from the collision of motives with a timeless intelligible character, though the intellect, knowing decisions only a posteriori, fancies empirical freedom. Knowledge serves will; character is innate. Repentance corrects errors of knowledge, not will. Acquired character is lucid self-knowledge that steadies conduct; viewed sub specie necessitatis, inner and outer events console without licensing vice.

§§56–57: At the summit, two global maxims remain—assertion of the will (life as endless, unsatisfiable striving) or its denial (self‑renunciation). Existence oscillates between pain (lack) and boredom (satiety); sharper minds suffer more. Art’s will‑less contemplation offers brief respite; broader insight fosters stoic equanimity, moderating joy and grief and preparing the way for the possibility of genuine self‑denial.

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Book IV turns to human action. Schopenhauer insists philosophy remains theoretical: it explains what is, it does not prescribe “oughts,” give duties, or produce virtue—no more than aesthetics creates artists. Virtue and vice flow from one’s immutable intelligible character, not from moral systems.
- He rejects an “absolute ought” or “law of freedom” as contradictory. In his system the will is truly autonomous and “almighty”: it determines both action and the world; both are the will’s self-knowledge. Hence there is no external moral law to which a “free” will should conform.
- Method: maintain immanence. Do not misuse the principle of sufficient reason (PSR) to leap beyond experience into empty abstractions (“absolute,” “infinite”) or historical cosmogonies. Genuine philosophy asks “what” (inner nature), not whence/whither/why, and knows the Ideas beyond the PSR’s relations. From this same insight spring art and the disposition leading to holiness.
- §54 recaps: the world as idea is will’s mirror; man is its highest grade, with reason unifying action. Will is a blind striving that, through representation, knows that it wills life; “will to live” is pleonastic. As thing‑in‑itself, will (and the knowing subject) is untouched by birth and death; these belong to phenomena under space, time, causality and individuation. Generation and death are correlative poles of life (symbolized by Siva’s skulls and lingam; life scenes on sarcophagi). The death of individuals does not affect nature or the will to live.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Generation and death are correlatives that neutralize each other. Ancient sarcophagi depicting revelry and sexuality tacitly direct mourners from an individual’s death to nature’s undying life: the world is the manifestation and fulfillment of the will to live.
- Formally, life appears under time, space, and causality, producing individuation; thus individuals must arise and perish. Nature cares only for the species (Idea), not individuals—hence prodigal seed, strong reproductive impulse, and the readiness to let individuals fall once their species-function is served. This “naively” affirms that only Ideas (not individuals) are the will’s complete objectification.
- Life is continual matter-change with form’s persistence: nourishment is reproduction at a lower power; reproduction is nourishment at a higher power; excretion is death at a lower power. Hence embalming is as senseless as preserving excrement. Individual consciousness already ceases daily in sleep; deep sleep is death without the future awakening.
- The real form of life is only the present; past and future exist merely as concepts under the PSR. The present is the contact-point of time-bound object and timeless subject—fixed like a rainbow over a waterfall; metaphysically, a nunc stans. Life is assured to will; the present to life. Therefore fearing death as loss of the present is an illusion, like thinking one might slip off the globe’s “upper” side.
- Affirmers of life may regard it as endless “eternal noon”; suicide offers no deliverance from life’s essence. Animals live unafraid as nature itself; humans, despite abstract knowledge of death, mostly live as if immortal, guided by nature’s stronger voice.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Nature’s voice grounds our everyday fearlessness about death: animals live untroubled, and humans, though abstractly certain of death, rarely integrate it into “living” consciousness. This pervasive confidence arises from an inward awareness that we are Nature/the world itself; mere psychological appeals to habit are insufficient.
- Hence widespread doctrines of personal immortality persist despite weak evidence. Schopenhauer distinguishes his view: the will (thing‑in‑itself) and the pure knowing subject lie outside time; permanence and transience apply only to phenomena. Individually we perish as appearances, but as thing‑in‑itself we are the same will in all; death abolishes the illusion isolating our consciousness—this, not endless duration, is “immortality.”
- Fear of death targets the end of the individual, not pain. Reason can mitigate this by shifting to the universal standpoint: one who gladly affirms life could face death indifferently, assured that life and the present are secure to the will (Gita’s Arjuna; Goethe’s Prometheus; kinship with Bruno/Spinoza).
- Assertion vs denial of the will arise from “living” insight, not abstract doctrine: assertion wills life knowingly; denial occurs when insight quiets and suppresses willing. Philosophy can only describe, not prescribe; the will has no law.
- §55: Double aspect—phenomena are strictly necessary under the PSR; the will, as thing‑in‑itself, lies outside the PSR and is free.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- All phenomena are absolutely necessary under the principle of sufficient reason (PSR): every event has a determinate ground; necessity = consequent from a given reason. This applies without exception to nature’s totality.

- The same world, considered in itself, is objectification of will. As thing‑in‑itself, will is outside the PSR and thus “free” in a merely negative sense (not necessitated). Freedom pertains to what the world is and that it is, not to how events unfold once appearing.

- Reconciliation: the object’s existence and specific character (the Idea it manifests) express free will; but once appearing, it is bound in the causal chain and cannot be otherwise. Hence humans, as will’s highest appearance, act with necessity from the coincidence of motives with their character.

- Exceptional case preview: through highest knowledge the will may deny itself, so freedom paradoxically appears in the phenomenon as a “contradiction” within it (holiness, self‑renunciation). This will be developed later.

- Ordinary agency: the person is never free; he is the determined manifestation of a timeless “intelligible character” (will outside time) expressed as an “empirical character” (lawlike conduct in time/space). Analogy: all deeds repeat one tendency, as a tree’s structure repeats its fibre.

- Illusion of empirical free choice arises because the intellect knows the will’s decisions only a posteriori and is ignorant of the intelligible character; thus alternative actions seem possible (like a tipping beam “could” fall either way). Deliberation can only clarify motives; it cannot determine the will. The final decision is necessary from character plus motives, though it appears to consciousness only when it occurs.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- The intellect can only clarify motives; it cannot determine the will. In deliberation it arrays pro and contra so each motive exerts full force when action is possible, then passively awaits the decision as if from another’s will—hence the illusion of empirical freedom.
- In reality, each choice issues necessarily from the agent’s timeless intelligible character in conflict with given motives. If will lay in time, change would be possible; but as thing‑in‑itself (per Kant and Schopenhauer), it is outside time/PSR. Thus, with empirical character and motives fully known, future conduct would be as calculable as an eclipse. Causes (nature) and motives (action) are merely occasional conditions; the character is constant.
- Schopenhauer rejects the view (Descartes, Spinoza) that knowledge is primary and will derivative. Will is original; knowledge is an instrument of its appearance. We come to know what we will (through experience), not to will what we know. Character (ethos) is innate and steadfast; theology’s predestination dimly reflects this truth, though its doctrinal consequences are rejected.
- Motives act only as known (causa finalis moves qua cognized). Changes in knowledge can alter conduct (means, objects) without changing the will’s end: velle non discitur. Real and even imaginary beliefs (e.g., deferred rewards) can motivate as if real.
- Character unfolds as knowledge matures: youth may differ from age; bad traits often intensify; opposing motives later known can check passions. We are “innocent” until motives appear in knowledge.
- Repentance stems from corrected knowledge, not a changed will: one cannot repent what one willed, only what one did under error (haste, misjudged needs/others, dogmas). True repentance seeks amends; beware self‑deception in feigned “impulsivity.”
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Repentance stems from corrected knowledge, not a changed will (which is timeless and unalterable). Rash deeds done under present perception and strong emotion, without abstract deliberation, can be regretted; true repentance shows itself by making amends. People may even stage “impulsive” acts to deceive themselves. Conversely, acting less egoistically than one’s character (through naiveté, misplaced trust, or obsolete dogma) yields a different regret. Analogy: just as matter obstructs perfect beauty (will’s spatial form), imperfect knowledge distorts action (will’s temporal form), producing repentance.

- Anguish of conscience is not repentance but painful self-knowledge that one still has the same will; if the will had changed, the pain would cease.

- Human vs brute agency: brutes are moved by present perceptible motives; humans by abstract concepts enabling a thorough conflict of motives (“choice”). Necessity still reigns: the strongest motive prevails given the fixed character, though this necessity is less visible in humans. Descartes and Spinoza erred by identifying will with judgment; the outcome (necessitation) is right only when grounded in character plus motives.

- Reason lets humans discount present impressions for abstract consequences: privation is easy, renunciation (future) hard. Mental suffering from thoughts exceeds physical pain, can prompt self-harm or suicide; care/passion wear the body more than hardship.

- Only deeds (resolves realized) manifest individual character; wishes mirror species-level responsiveness. Unconsidered deeds are intermediate and can be effaced by actionable repentance.

- UpShot: As thing‑in‑itself, will is free; as phenomenon it is necessitated by motives and character. Yet a unique appearance of real freedom is possible when knowledge of the Ideas sees through individuation, yielding self‑renunciation—explained later. Anticipation: this does not license fatalism (“argos logos,” “Turkish faith”).
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- After establishing the unalterable empirical character (temporal unfolding of the timeless intelligible character) and the necessity of action from motives, Schopenhauer anticipates a misuse: “since I can’t change, I should indulge.” He rebuts this as argos logos (fatalism). Following Chrysippus (via Cicero), even if “fate” determines events, it does so through causes: no effect without its proper means. Likewise, our deeds flow from character, but we do not know our character a priori; we learn it only a posteriori through experience.

- One’s resolves reveal “what manner of man” one is; the later satisfaction or anguish at one’s past stems from their significance as mirrors of one’s will, which motivates present striving to shape a consoling “picture.”

- Beyond intelligible and empirical character, there is acquired character: not a change of will, but clear, abstract self-knowledge of one’s fixed tendencies and the measure/direction of one’s powers. Because reason projects species-wide possibilities that can distort expression, self-ignorance leads to zigzagging, incompatible pursuits, envy, abortive efforts, and “too noble” deeds done from concepts that later provoke egoistic repentance (velle non discitur).

- Acquired character requires renunciation: life’s path is a line; success in any end (pleasure, honor, wealth, science, art, virtue) demands foregoing others (Hobbesian analogy of exclusive right through renunciation). With self-knowledge come firm maxims, steadiness, fitting choice of occupations, avoidance of overreach, fewer mortifications, and rejection of dissimulation or imitation.

- Viewing events sub specie necessitatis consoles: recognizing evils as inevitable products of inner and outer conditions tames revolt, without licensing vice beforehand.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Consolation through necessity: Viewing events sub specie necessitatis (fatalism) powerfully soothes discontent. We cease “storming” once we clearly see something cannot be otherwise (examples: entrapped elephants, King David). Many bear permanent ills indifferently because they know change is impossible. The same holds for inward necessity: clear recognition of one’s fixed strengths/limits, setting aims accordingly, and renouncing the unattainable best averts the bitterest sorrow—self-discontent. This closes the account of acquired character (pragmatic self-knowledge) and the survey of intelligible/empirical character, showing the will’s phenomena are necessitated though will-in-itself is “free/omnipotent.”

- §56. At the summit of self-consciousness, will can express itself in two global maxims: (a) assertion—continuing to will as before, with knowledge as its instrument; or (b) denial—knowledge quiets and suppresses willing. This does not alter particular deeds piecemeal but reshapes the whole manner of life. To ground this, Schopenhauer reexamines life’s essence and the payoff of asserting the will.

- Will’s essence is endless striving without final aim; no attained end satisfies. Nature exhibits restless, aimless tendency (gravity, phase changes, electricity, galvanism, plant life) and universal conflict for matter; hindrance = suffering, attainment = fleeting satisfaction. Because effort springs from lack, suffering is ubiquitous; satisfaction only starts new striving.

- Consciousness intensifies suffering: it is slight in lower animals, increases with nervous development, and peaks in humans; the more lucid the mind, the greater the pain—genius suffers most (Ecclesiastes; Tischbein’s drawing).

- §57. Individuation under space/time makes human existence a constant “dying”: only the present is real and it incessantly passes; bodily life is ceaselessly postponed death; mental activity defers boredom. Death is inevitable, yet we solicitously prolong life like a soap-bubble. Life oscillates between pain (from need) and ennui (when desire lacks objects). At higher grades, striving is anchored in the body’s “iron” command to nourish itself—the body being the objectified will to live.
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Will = endless, unquenchable striving grounded in need; thus pain is original to animal and human nature. When wants are quickly satisfied, emptiness (ennui) ensues. Life swings between pain (lack) and boredom (surfeit).
- At higher objectification, will appears as a living body under an “iron” command to nourish itself; the body just is the objectified will to live. Hence man, the most complete objectification, is the most necessitous—beset by daily maintenance, species-propagation, and constant dangers. Fear of death, more than love of life, sustains the struggle; life is a perilous voyage ending inevitably in shipwreck (death).
- When want abates, boredom presses; society supplies diversions (panem et circenses). Ennui can be punitive (e.g., solitary confinement) and drives excesses; want scourges the poor, ennui the fashionable; Sunday vs weekdays mirrors this.
- Desire is painful; attainment breeds satiety; happiest life moderates the tempo of this alternation. Pure, will‑less contemplation (art/knowledge) briefly relieves but is rare; stronger intellects suffer more and are isolated. Most people need will‑stimulation (e.g., teasing animals, writing names, card‑playing).
- Pain is inescapable and merely changes form (lust, envy, anxiety, illness, etc.); if excluded, ennui returns.
- Consolation and hypothesis: recognizing pain’s inevitability can foster stoic equanimity. Each person likely has a fixed, temperament‑set “quota” of suffering; events only redistribute it. Great sorrows mute lesser ills and vice versa; moods often shift without external cause. A dominant care concentrates suffering (like a blister); remove it and latent cares immediately fill the vacuum.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Extending the “fixed quota” hypothesis: At any time a person’s capacity for suffering is subjectively set. A dominant external “chief care” merely concentrates pain that would otherwise disperse across many petty annoyances; once it vanishes, latent material instantly swells to occupy the vacant “throne” of care, even if objectively lighter.

- Excessive joy and acute grief typically occur in the same highly active minds and arise less from what is present than from anticipations of the future. Because pain belongs essentially to life and its degree is fixed by the subject’s nature, sudden external changes cannot truly alter its overall measure.

- Hence immoderate joy and grief rest on delusion: joy presumes a lasting satisfaction life cannot provide; its collapse produces a proportional fall into pain. Both extremes can be avoided by knowledge that surveys things as a whole, resists wishful coloring, and recognizes the inevitability of renewed lack.

- This is the Stoic ideal: freeing the mind from such illusions to achieve stable equanimity—a stance exemplified by Horace’s counsel—prefiguring Schopenhauer’s call for insight-led moderation of affect.
