- Consolation through necessity: Viewing events sub specie necessitatis (fatalism) powerfully soothes discontent. We cease “storming” once we clearly see something cannot be otherwise (examples: entrapped elephants, King David). Many bear permanent ills indifferently because they know change is impossible. The same holds for inward necessity: clear recognition of one’s fixed strengths/limits, setting aims accordingly, and renouncing the unattainable best averts the bitterest sorrow—self-discontent. This closes the account of acquired character (pragmatic self-knowledge) and the survey of intelligible/empirical character, showing the will’s phenomena are necessitated though will-in-itself is “free/omnipotent.”

- §56. At the summit of self-consciousness, will can express itself in two global maxims: (a) assertion—continuing to will as before, with knowledge as its instrument; or (b) denial—knowledge quiets and suppresses willing. This does not alter particular deeds piecemeal but reshapes the whole manner of life. To ground this, Schopenhauer reexamines life’s essence and the payoff of asserting the will.

- Will’s essence is endless striving without final aim; no attained end satisfies. Nature exhibits restless, aimless tendency (gravity, phase changes, electricity, galvanism, plant life) and universal conflict for matter; hindrance = suffering, attainment = fleeting satisfaction. Because effort springs from lack, suffering is ubiquitous; satisfaction only starts new striving.

- Consciousness intensifies suffering: it is slight in lower animals, increases with nervous development, and peaks in humans; the more lucid the mind, the greater the pain—genius suffers most (Ecclesiastes; Tischbein’s drawing).

- §57. Individuation under space/time makes human existence a constant “dying”: only the present is real and it incessantly passes; bodily life is ceaselessly postponed death; mental activity defers boredom. Death is inevitable, yet we solicitously prolong life like a soap-bubble. Life oscillates between pain (from need) and ennui (when desire lacks objects). At higher grades, striving is anchored in the body’s “iron” command to nourish itself—the body being the objectified will to live.
