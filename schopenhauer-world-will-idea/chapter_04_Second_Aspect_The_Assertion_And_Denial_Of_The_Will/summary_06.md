- Repentance stems from corrected knowledge, not a changed will (which is timeless and unalterable). Rash deeds done under present perception and strong emotion, without abstract deliberation, can be regretted; true repentance shows itself by making amends. People may even stage “impulsive” acts to deceive themselves. Conversely, acting less egoistically than one’s character (through naiveté, misplaced trust, or obsolete dogma) yields a different regret. Analogy: just as matter obstructs perfect beauty (will’s spatial form), imperfect knowledge distorts action (will’s temporal form), producing repentance.

- Anguish of conscience is not repentance but painful self-knowledge that one still has the same will; if the will had changed, the pain would cease.

- Human vs brute agency: brutes are moved by present perceptible motives; humans by abstract concepts enabling a thorough conflict of motives (“choice”). Necessity still reigns: the strongest motive prevails given the fixed character, though this necessity is less visible in humans. Descartes and Spinoza erred by identifying will with judgment; the outcome (necessitation) is right only when grounded in character plus motives.

- Reason lets humans discount present impressions for abstract consequences: privation is easy, renunciation (future) hard. Mental suffering from thoughts exceeds physical pain, can prompt self-harm or suicide; care/passion wear the body more than hardship.

- Only deeds (resolves realized) manifest individual character; wishes mirror species-level responsiveness. Unconsidered deeds are intermediate and can be effaced by actionable repentance.

- UpShot: As thing‑in‑itself, will is free; as phenomenon it is necessitated by motives and character. Yet a unique appearance of real freedom is possible when knowledge of the Ideas sees through individuation, yielding self‑renunciation—explained later. Anticipation: this does not license fatalism (“argos logos,” “Turkish faith”).
