- The intellect can only clarify motives; it cannot determine the will. In deliberation it arrays pro and contra so each motive exerts full force when action is possible, then passively awaits the decision as if from another’s will—hence the illusion of empirical freedom.
- In reality, each choice issues necessarily from the agent’s timeless intelligible character in conflict with given motives. If will lay in time, change would be possible; but as thing‑in‑itself (per Kant and Schopenhauer), it is outside time/PSR. Thus, with empirical character and motives fully known, future conduct would be as calculable as an eclipse. Causes (nature) and motives (action) are merely occasional conditions; the character is constant.
- Schopenhauer rejects the view (Descartes, Spinoza) that knowledge is primary and will derivative. Will is original; knowledge is an instrument of its appearance. We come to know what we will (through experience), not to will what we know. Character (ethos) is innate and steadfast; theology’s predestination dimly reflects this truth, though its doctrinal consequences are rejected.
- Motives act only as known (causa finalis moves qua cognized). Changes in knowledge can alter conduct (means, objects) without changing the will’s end: velle non discitur. Real and even imaginary beliefs (e.g., deferred rewards) can motivate as if real.
- Character unfolds as knowledge matures: youth may differ from age; bad traits often intensify; opposing motives later known can check passions. We are “innocent” until motives appear in knowledge.
- Repentance stems from corrected knowledge, not a changed will: one cannot repent what one willed, only what one did under error (haste, misjudged needs/others, dogmas). True repentance seeks amends; beware self‑deception in feigned “impulsivity.”
