- Book IV turns to human action. Schopenhauer insists philosophy remains theoretical: it explains what is, it does not prescribe “oughts,” give duties, or produce virtue—no more than aesthetics creates artists. Virtue and vice flow from one’s immutable intelligible character, not from moral systems.
- He rejects an “absolute ought” or “law of freedom” as contradictory. In his system the will is truly autonomous and “almighty”: it determines both action and the world; both are the will’s self-knowledge. Hence there is no external moral law to which a “free” will should conform.
- Method: maintain immanence. Do not misuse the principle of sufficient reason (PSR) to leap beyond experience into empty abstractions (“absolute,” “infinite”) or historical cosmogonies. Genuine philosophy asks “what” (inner nature), not whence/whither/why, and knows the Ideas beyond the PSR’s relations. From this same insight spring art and the disposition leading to holiness.
- §54 recaps: the world as idea is will’s mirror; man is its highest grade, with reason unifying action. Will is a blind striving that, through representation, knows that it wills life; “will to live” is pleonastic. As thing‑in‑itself, will (and the knowing subject) is untouched by birth and death; these belong to phenomena under space, time, causality and individuation. Generation and death are correlative poles of life (symbolized by Siva’s skulls and lingam; life scenes on sarcophagi). The death of individuals does not affect nature or the will to live.
