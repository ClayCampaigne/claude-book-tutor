- Will = endless, unquenchable striving grounded in need; thus pain is original to animal and human nature. When wants are quickly satisfied, emptiness (ennui) ensues. Life swings between pain (lack) and boredom (surfeit).
- At higher objectification, will appears as a living body under an “iron” command to nourish itself; the body just is the objectified will to live. Hence man, the most complete objectification, is the most necessitous—beset by daily maintenance, species-propagation, and constant dangers. Fear of death, more than love of life, sustains the struggle; life is a perilous voyage ending inevitably in shipwreck (death).
- When want abates, boredom presses; society supplies diversions (panem et circenses). Ennui can be punitive (e.g., solitary confinement) and drives excesses; want scourges the poor, ennui the fashionable; Sunday vs weekdays mirrors this.
- Desire is painful; attainment breeds satiety; happiest life moderates the tempo of this alternation. Pure, will‑less contemplation (art/knowledge) briefly relieves but is rare; stronger intellects suffer more and are isolated. Most people need will‑stimulation (e.g., teasing animals, writing names, card‑playing).
- Pain is inescapable and merely changes form (lust, envy, anxiety, illness, etc.); if excluded, ennui returns.
- Consolation and hypothesis: recognizing pain’s inevitability can foster stoic equanimity. Each person likely has a fixed, temperament‑set “quota” of suffering; events only redistribute it. Great sorrows mute lesser ills and vice versa; moods often shift without external cause. A dominant care concentrates suffering (like a blister); remove it and latent cares immediately fill the vacuum.
