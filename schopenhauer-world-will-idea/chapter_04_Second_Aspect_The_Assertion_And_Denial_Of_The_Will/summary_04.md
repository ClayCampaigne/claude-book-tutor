- All phenomena are absolutely necessary under the principle of sufficient reason (PSR): every event has a determinate ground; necessity = consequent from a given reason. This applies without exception to nature’s totality.

- The same world, considered in itself, is objectification of will. As thing‑in‑itself, will is outside the PSR and thus “free” in a merely negative sense (not necessitated). Freedom pertains to what the world is and that it is, not to how events unfold once appearing.

- Reconciliation: the object’s existence and specific character (the Idea it manifests) express free will; but once appearing, it is bound in the causal chain and cannot be otherwise. Hence humans, as will’s highest appearance, act with necessity from the coincidence of motives with their character.

- Exceptional case preview: through highest knowledge the will may deny itself, so freedom paradoxically appears in the phenomenon as a “contradiction” within it (holiness, self‑renunciation). This will be developed later.

- Ordinary agency: the person is never free; he is the determined manifestation of a timeless “intelligible character” (will outside time) expressed as an “empirical character” (lawlike conduct in time/space). Analogy: all deeds repeat one tendency, as a tree’s structure repeats its fibre.

- Illusion of empirical free choice arises because the intellect knows the will’s decisions only a posteriori and is ignorant of the intelligible character; thus alternative actions seem possible (like a tipping beam “could” fall either way). Deliberation can only clarify motives; it cannot determine the will. The final decision is necessary from character plus motives, though it appears to consciousness only when it occurs.
