- Generation and death are correlatives that neutralize each other. Ancient sarcophagi depicting revelry and sexuality tacitly direct mourners from an individual’s death to nature’s undying life: the world is the manifestation and fulfillment of the will to live.
- Formally, life appears under time, space, and causality, producing individuation; thus individuals must arise and perish. Nature cares only for the species (Idea), not individuals—hence prodigal seed, strong reproductive impulse, and the readiness to let individuals fall once their species-function is served. This “naively” affirms that only Ideas (not individuals) are the will’s complete objectification.
- Life is continual matter-change with form’s persistence: nourishment is reproduction at a lower power; reproduction is nourishment at a higher power; excretion is death at a lower power. Hence embalming is as senseless as preserving excrement. Individual consciousness already ceases daily in sleep; deep sleep is death without the future awakening.
- The real form of life is only the present; past and future exist merely as concepts under the PSR. The present is the contact-point of time-bound object and timeless subject—fixed like a rainbow over a waterfall; metaphysically, a nunc stans. Life is assured to will; the present to life. Therefore fearing death as loss of the present is an illusion, like thinking one might slip off the globe’s “upper” side.
- Affirmers of life may regard it as endless “eternal noon”; suicide offers no deliverance from life’s essence. Animals live unafraid as nature itself; humans, despite abstract knowledge of death, mostly live as if immortal, guided by nature’s stronger voice.
