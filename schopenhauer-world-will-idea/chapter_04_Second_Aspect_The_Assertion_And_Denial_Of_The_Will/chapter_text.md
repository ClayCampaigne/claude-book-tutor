[pg 349]
§ 53. The last
          part of our work presents itself as the most serious, for it
          relates to the action of men, the matter which concerns every one
          directly and can be foreign or indifferent to none. It is indeed so
          characteristic of the nature of man to relate everything else to
          action, that in every systematic investigation he will always treat
          the part that has to do with action as the result or outcome of the
          whole work, so far, at least, as it interests him, and will
          therefore give his most serious attention to this part, even if to
          no other. In this respect the following part of our work would, in
          ordinary language, be called practical philosophy, in opposition to
          the theoretical, which has occupied us hitherto. But, in my
          opinion, all philosophy is theoretical, because it is essential to
          it that it should retain a purely contemplative attitude, and
          should investigate, not prescribe. To become, on the contrary,
          practical, to guide conduct, to transform character, are old
          claims, which with fuller insight it ought finally to give up. For
          here, where the worth or worthlessness of an existence, where
          salvation or damnation are in question, the dead conceptions of
          philosophy do not decide the matter, but the inmost nature of man
          himself, the Dæmon that guides him and that has not chosen him, but
          been chosen by him, as Plato would say; his intelligible character,
          as Kant expresses himself. Virtue cannot be taught any more than
          genius; indeed, for it the concept is just as unfruitful as it is
          in art, and in both cases can only be used as [pg 350] an instrument. It would, therefore, be
          just as absurd to expect that our moral systems and ethics will
          produce virtuous, noble, and holy men, as that our æsthetics will
          produce poets, painters, and musicians.
Philosophy can
          never do more than interpret and explain what is given. It can only
          bring to distinct abstract knowledge of the reason the nature of
          the world which in the concrete, that is, as feeling, expresses
          itself comprehensibly to every one. This, however, it does in every
          possible reference and from every point of view. Now, as this
          attempt has been made from other points of view in the three
          preceding books with the generality that is proper to philosophy,
          in this book the action of men will be considered in the same way;
          and this side of the world might, indeed, be considered the most
          important of all, not only subjectively, as I remarked above, but
          also objectively. In considering it I shall faithfully adhere to
          the method I have hitherto followed, and shall support myself by
          presupposing all that has already been advanced. There is, indeed,
          just one thought which forms the content of this whole work. I have
          endeavoured to work it out in all other spheres, and I shall now do
          so with regard to human action. I shall then have done all that is
          in my power to communicate it as fully as possible.
The given point
          of view, and the method of treatment announced, are themselves
          sufficient to indicate that in this ethical book no precepts, no
          doctrine of duty must be looked for; still less will a general
          moral principle be given, an universal receipt, as it were, for the
          production of all the virtues. Neither shall we talk of an
          “absolute ought,” for this
          contains a contradiction, as is explained in the Appendix; nor yet
          of a “law of freedom,” which is
          in the same position. In general, we shall not speak at all of
          “ought,” for this is how one speaks
          to children and to nations still in their childhood, but not to
          those who have appropriated all the culture of a full-grown
          [pg 351] age. It is a
          palpable contradiction to call the will free, and yet to prescribe
          laws for it according to which it ought to will. “Ought to will!”—wooden iron! But it follows
          from the point of view of our system that the will is not only
          free, but almighty. From it proceeds not only its action, but also
          its world; and as the will is, so does its action and its world
          become. Both are the self-knowledge of the will and nothing more.
          The will determines itself, and at the same time both its action
          and its world; for besides it there is nothing, and these are the
          will itself. Only thus is the will truly autonomous, and from every
          other point of view it is heteronomous. Our philosophical
          endeavours can only extend to exhibiting and explaining the action
          of men in its inner nature and content, the various and even
          opposite maxims, whose living expression it is. This we shall do in
          connection with the preceding portion of our work, and in precisely
          the same way as we have hitherto explained the other phenomena of
          the world, and have sought to bring their inmost nature to distinct
          abstract knowledge. Our philosophy will maintain the same
          immanency in the case of action,
          as in all that we have hitherto considered. Notwithstanding Kant's
          great doctrine, it will not attempt to use the forms of the
          phenomenon, the universal expression of which is the principle of
          sufficient reason, as a leaping-pole to jump over the phenomenon
          itself, which alone gives meaning to these forms, and land in the
          boundless sphere of empty fictions. But this actual world of
          experience, in which we are, and which is in us, remains both the
          material and the limits of our consideration: a world which is so
          rich in content that even the most searching investigation of which
          the human mind is capable could not exhaust it. Since then the real
          world of experience will never fail to afford material and reality
          to our ethical investigations, any more than to those we have
          already conducted, nothing will be less needful than to take refuge
          in negative conceptions [pg
          352]
          void of content, and then somehow or other make even ourselves
          believe that we are saying something when we speak with lifted
          eyebrows of “absolutes,”
“infinites,” “supersensibles,” and whatever other mere
          negations of this sort there may be (ουδεν εστι, η το της στερησεως
          ονομα, μετα αμυδρας επινοιας—nihil est, nisi negationis nomen, cum obscura
          notione.—Jul. or. 5), instead of which it would be
          shorter to say at once cloud-cuckoo-town (νεφελοκοκκυγια): we shall
          not require to serve up covered empty dishes of this kind. Finally,
          we shall not in this book, any more than in those which have
          preceded it, narrate histories and give them out as philosophy. For
          we are of opinion that whoever supposes that the inner nature of
          the world can in any way, however plausibly disguised, be
          historically comprehended, is
          infinitely far from a philosophical knowledge of the world. Yet
          this is what is supposed whenever a “becoming,” or a “having
          become,” or an “about to
          become” enters into a theory of the nature of the world,
          whenever an earlier or a later has the least place in it; and in
          this way a beginning and an end of the world, and the path it
          pursues between them, is, either openly or disguisedly, both sought
          for and found, and the individual who philosophises even recognises
          his own position on that path. Such historical
          philosophising in most cases produces a cosmogony which
          admits of many varieties, or else a system of emanations, a
          doctrine of successive disengagements from one being; or, finally,
          driven in despair from fruitless efforts upon these paths to the
          last path of all, it takes refuge in the converse doctrine of a
          constant becoming, springing up, arising, coming to light out of
          darkness, out of the hidden ground source or groundlessness, or
          whatever other nonsense of this sort there may be, which is most
          shortly disposed of with the remark that at the present moment a
          whole eternity, i.e., an endless time, has
          already passed, so that everything that can or ought to become must
          have already done so. For all such historical philosophy, whatever
          [pg 353] airs it may give
          itself, regards time just as if Kant had never
          lived, as a quality of the thing-in-itself, and thus stops at that
          which Kant calls the phenomenon in opposition to the
          thing-in-itself; which Plato calls the becoming and never being, in
          opposition to the being and never becoming; and which, finally, is
          called in the Indian philosophy the web of Mâya. It is just the
          knowledge which belongs to the principle of sufficient reason, with
          which no one can penetrate to the inner nature of things, but
          endlessly pursues phenomena, moving without end or aim, like a
          squirrel in its wheel, till, tired out at last, he stops at some
          point or other arbitrarily chosen, and now desires to extort
          respect for it from others also. The genuine philosophical
          consideration of the world, i.e., the consideration that
          affords us a knowledge of its inner nature, and so leads us beyond
          the phenomenon, is precisely that method which does not concern
          itself with the whence, the whither, and the why of the world, but
          always and everywhere demands only the what; the method which
          considers things not according to any relation, not as becoming and
          passing away, in short, not according to one of the four forms of
          the principle of sufficient reason; but, on the contrary, just that
          which remains when all that belongs to the form of knowledge proper
          to that principle has been abstracted, the inner nature of the
          world, which always appears unchanged in all the relations, but is
          itself never subject to them, and has the Ideas of the world as its
          object or material. From such knowledge as this proceeds
          philosophy, like art, and also, as we shall see in this book, that
          disposition of mind which alone leads to true holiness and to
          deliverance from the world.
§ 54. The first
          three books will, it is hoped, have conveyed the distinct and
          certain knowledge that the world as idea is the complete mirror of
          the will, in which it knows itself in ascending grades of
          distinctness [pg
          354]
          and completeness, the highest of which is man, whose nature,
          however, receives its complete expression only through the whole
          connected series of his actions. The self-conscious connection of
          these actions is made possible by reason, which enables a man
          constantly to survey the whole in the abstract.
The will, which,
          considered purely in itself, is without knowledge, and is merely a
          blind incessant impulse, as we see it appear in unorganised and
          vegetable nature and their laws, and also in the vegetative part of
          our own life, receives through the addition of the world as idea,
          which is developed in subjection to it, the knowledge of its own
          willing and of what it is that it wills. And this is nothing else
          than the world as idea, life, precisely as it exists. Therefore we
          called the phenomenal world the mirror of the will, its
          objectivity. And since what the will wills is always life, just
          because life is nothing but the representation of that willing for
          the idea, it is all one and a mere pleonism if, instead of simply
          saying “the will,” we say
          “the will to live.”
Will is the
          thing-in-itself, the inner content, the essence of the world. Life,
          the visible world, the phenomenon, is only the mirror of the will.
          Therefore life accompanies the will as inseparably as the shadow
          accompanies the body; and if will exists, so will life, the world,
          exist. Life is, therefore, assured to the will to live; and so long
          as we are filled with the will to live we need have no fear for our
          existence, even in the presence of death. It is true we see the
          individual come into being and pass away; but the individual is
          only phenomenal, exists only for the knowledge which is bound to
          the principle of sufficient reason, to the principio individuationis.
          Certainly, for this kind of knowledge, the individual receives his
          life as a gift, rises out of nothing, then suffers the loss of this
          gift through death, and returns again to nothing. But we desire to
          consider life [pg
          355]
          philosophically, i.e., according to its Ideas,
          and in this sphere we shall find that neither the will, the
          thing-in-itself in all phenomena, nor the subject of knowing, that
          which perceives all phenomena, is affected at all by birth or by
          death. Birth and death belong merely to the phenomenon of will,
          thus to life; and it is essential to this to exhibit itself in
          individuals which come into being and pass away, as fleeting
          phenomena appearing in the form of time—phenomena of that which in
          itself knows no time, but must exhibit itself precisely in the way
          we have said, in order to objectify its peculiar nature. Birth and
          death belong in like manner to life, and hold the balance as
          reciprocal conditions of each other, or, if one likes the
          expression, as poles of the whole phenomenon of life. The wisest of
          all mythologies, the Indian, expresses this by giving to the very
          god that symbolises destruction, death (as Brahma, the most sinful
          and the lowest god of the Trimurti, symbolises generation, coming
          into being, and Vishnu maintaining or preserving), by giving, I
          say, to Siva as an attribute not only the necklace of skulls, but
          also the lingam, the symbol of generation, which appears here as
          the counterpart of death, thus signifying that generation and death
          are essentially correlatives, which reciprocally neutralise and
          annul each other. It was precisely the same sentiment that led the
          Greeks and Romans to adorn their costly sarcophagi, just as we see
          them now, with feasts, dances, marriages, the chase, fights of wild
          beasts, bacchanalians, &c.; thus with representations of the
          full ardour of life, which they place before us not only in such
          revels and sports, but also in sensual groups, and even go so far
          as to represent the sexual intercourse of satyrs and goats. Clearly
          the aim was to point in the most impressive manner away from the
          death of the mourned individual to the immortal life of nature, and
          thus to indicate, though without abstract knowledge, that the whole
          of nature is the phenomenon and also the fulfilment of the will to
          live. The form of [pg
          356]
          this phenomenon is time, space, and causality, and by means of
          these individuation, which carries with it that the individual must
          come into being and pass away. But this no more affects the will to
          live, of whose manifestation the individual is, as it were, only a
          particular example or specimen, than the death of an individual
          injures the whole of nature. For it is not the individual, but only
          the species that Nature cares for, and for the preservation of
          which she so earnestly strives, providing for it with the utmost
          prodigality through the vast surplus of the seed and the great
          strength of the fructifying impulse. The individual, on the
          contrary, neither has nor can have any value for Nature, for her
          kingdom is infinite time and infinite space, and in these infinite
          multiplicity of possible individuals. Therefore she is always ready
          to let the individual fall, and hence it is not only exposed to
          destruction in a thousand ways by the most insignificant accident,
          but originally destined for it, and conducted towards it by Nature
          herself from the moment it has served its end of maintaining the
          species. Thus Nature naïvely expresses the great truth that only
          the Ideas, not the individuals, have, properly speaking, reality,
          i.e., are complete objectivity
          of the will. Now, since man is Nature itself, and indeed Nature at
          the highest grade of its self-consciousness, but Nature is only the
          objectified will to live, the man who has comprehended and retained
          this point of view may well console himself, when contemplating his
          own death and that of his friends, by turning his eyes to the
          immortal life of Nature, which he himself is. This is the
          significance of Siva with the lingam, and of those ancient
          sarcophagi with their pictures of glowing life, which say to the
          mourning beholder, Natura non
          contristatur.
That generation
          and death are to be regarded as something belonging to life, and
          essential to this phenomenon of the will, arises also from the fact
          that they both exhibit themselves merely as higher powers of the
          expression [pg
          357]
          of that in which all the rest of life consists. This is through and
          through nothing else than the constant change of matter in the
          fixed permanence of form; and this is what constitutes the
          transitoriness of the individual and the permanence of the species.
          Constant nourishment and renewal differ from generation only in
          degree, and constant excretion differs only in degree from death.
          The first shows itself most simply and distinctly in the plant. The
          plant is throughout a constant recurrence of the same impulse of
          its simplest fibre, which groups itself into leaf and branch. It is
          a systematic aggregate of similar plants supporting each other,
          whose constant reproduction is its single impulse. It ascends to
          the full satisfaction of this tendency through the grades of its
          metamorphosis, finally to the blossom and fruit, that compendium of
          its existence and effort in which it now attains, by a short way,
          to that which is its single aim, and at a stroke produces a
          thousand-fold what, up till then, it effected only in the
          particular case—the repetition of itself. Its earlier growth and
          development stands in the same relation to its fruit as writing
          stands to printing. With the animal it is clearly quite the same.
          The process of nourishing is a constant reproduction; the process
          of reproduction is a higher power of nourishing. The pleasure which
          accompanies the act of procreation is a higher power of the
          agreeableness of the sense of life. On the other hand, excretion,
          the constant exhalation and throwing off of matter, is the same as
          that which, at a higher power, death, is the contrary of
          generation. And if here we are always content to retain the form
          without lamenting the discarded matter, we ought to bear ourselves
          in the same way if in death the same thing happens, in a higher
          degree and to the whole, as takes place daily and hourly in a
          partial manner in excretion: if we are indifferent to the one, we
          ought not to shrink from the other. Therefore, from this point of
          view, it appears just as perverse to desire [pg 358] the continuance of an individuality
          which will be replaced by other individuals as to desire the
          permanence of matter which will be replaced by other matter. It
          appears just as foolish to embalm the body as it would be carefully
          to preserve its excrement. As to the individual consciousness which
          is bound to the individual body, it is absolutely interrupted every
          day by sleep. Deep sleep is, while it lasts, in no way different
          from death, into which, in fact, it often passes continuously, as
          in the case of freezing to death. It differs only with regard to
          the future, the awaking. Death is a sleep in which individuality is
          forgotten; everything else wakes again, or rather never
          slept.64
Above all
          things, we must distinctly recognise that the form of the
          phenomenon of will, the form of life or reality, is really only the
          present, not the future nor the
          past. The latter are only in the conception, exist only in the
          connection of knowledge, so far as it follows the principle of
          sufficient reason. No man has ever lived in the past, and none will
          live in the future; the present alone is the form of all
          life, and is its sure possession which can never be taken from it.
          The present always exists, together with its content. Both remain
          fixed without wavering, like the rainbow on the waterfall. For life
          is firm and certain in the will, and the present is firm and
          certain in life. Certainly, if we reflect on [pg 359] the thousands of years that are past,
          of the millions of men who lived in them, we ask, What were they?
          what has become of them? But, on the other hand, we need only
          recall our own past life and renew its scenes vividly in our
          imagination, and then ask again, What was all this? what has become
          of it? As it is with it, so is it with the life of those millions.
          Or should we suppose that the past could receive a new existence
          because it has been sealed by death? Our own past, the most recent
          part of it, and even yesterday, is now no more than an empty dream
          of the fancy, and such is the past of all those millions. What was?
          What is? The will, of which life is the mirror, and knowledge free
          from will, which beholds it clearly in that mirror. Whoever has not
          yet recognised this, or will not recognise it, must add to the
          question asked above as to the fate of past generations of men this
          question also: Why he, the questioner, is so fortunate as to be
          conscious of this costly, fleeting, and only real present, while
          those hundreds of generations of men, even the heroes and
          philosophers of those ages, have sunk into the night of the past,
          and have thus become nothing; but he, his insignificant ego,
          actually exists? or more shortly, though somewhat strangely: Why
          this now, his now, is just now and was not
          long ago? Since he asks such strange questions, he regards his
          existence and his time as independent of each other, and the former
          as projected into the latter. He assumes indeed two nows—one which
          belongs to the object, the other which belongs to the subject, and
          marvels at the happy accident of their coincidence. But in truth,
          only the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time,
          with the subject, which has no mode of the principle of sufficient
          reason as its form, constitutes the present, as is shown in the
          essay on the principle of sufficient reason. Now all object is the
          will so far as it has become idea, and the subject is the necessary
          correlative of the object. But real objects are only in the
          [pg 360] present; the past
          and the future contain only conceptions and fancies, therefore the
          present is the essential form of the phenomenon of the will, and
          inseparable from it. The present alone is that which always exists
          and remains immovable. That which, empirically apprehended, is the
          most transitory of all, presents itself to the metaphysical vision,
          which sees beyond the forms of empirical perception, as that which
          alone endures, the nunc
          stans of the schoolmen. The source and the supporter
          of its content is the will to live or the thing-in-itself,—which we
          are. That which constantly becomes and passes away, in that it has
          either already been or is still to be, belongs to the phenomenon as
          such on account of its forms, which make coming into being and
          passing away possible. Accordingly, we must think:—Quid fuit?—Quod est. Quid erit?—Quod fuit; and take it in the
          strict meaning of the words; thus understand not simile but idem. For life is certain to the
          will, and the present is certain to life. Thus it is that every one
          can say, “I am once for all lord of the
          present, and through all eternity it will accompany me as my
          shadow: therefore I do not wonder where it has come from, and how
          it happens that it is exactly now.” We might compare time to
          a constantly revolving sphere; the half that was always sinking
          would be the past, that which was always rising would be the
          future; but the indivisible point at the top, where the tangent
          touches, would be the extensionless present. As the tangent does
          not revolve with the sphere, neither does the present, the point of
          contact of the object, the form of which is time, with the subject,
          which has no form, because it does not belong to the knowable, but
          is the condition of all that is knowable. Or, time is like an
          unceasing stream, and the present a rock on which the stream breaks
          itself, but does not carry away with it. The will, as
          thing-in-itself, is just as little subordinate to the principle of
          sufficient reason [pg
          361]
          as the subject of knowledge, which, finally, in a certain regard is
          the will itself or its expression. And as life, its own phenomenon,
          is assured to the will, so is the present, the single form of real
          life. Therefore we have not to investigate the past before life,
          nor the future after death: we have rather to know the present, the one form in which the
          will manifests itself.65 It
          will not escape from the will, but neither will the will escape
          from it. If, therefore, life as it is satisfies, whoever affirms it
          in every way may regard it with confidence as endless, and banish
          the fear of death as an illusion that inspires him with the foolish
          dread that he can ever be robbed of the present, and foreshadows a
          time in which there is no present; an illusion with regard to time
          analogous to the illusion with regard to space through which every
          one imagines the position on the globe he happens to occupy as
          above, and all other places as below. In the same way every one
          links the present to his own individuality, and imagines that all
          present is extinguished with it; that then past and future might be
          without a present. But as on the surface of the globe every place
          is above, so the form of all life is the present, and to fear death because
          it robs us of the present, is just as foolish as to fear that we
          may slip down from the round globe upon which we have now the good
          fortune to occupy the upper surface. The present is the form
          essential to the objectification of the will. It cuts time, which
          extends infinitely in both directions, as a mathematical point, and
          stands immovably fixed, like an everlasting mid-day with no cool
          evening, as the actual sun burns without intermission, while it
          only seems to sink into the bosom of night. Therefore, if a man
          fears death as his annihilation, it is just as if he were to think
          that the sun cries out at evening, “Woe is
          [pg 362] me! for I go down
          into eternal night.”66 And
          conversely, whoever is oppressed with the burden of life, whoever
          desires life and affirms it, but abhors its torments, and
          especially can no longer endure the hard lot that has fallen to
          himself, such a man has no deliverance to hope for from death, and
          cannot right himself by suicide. The cool shades of Orcus allure
          him only with the false appearance of a haven of rest. The earth
          rolls from day into night, the individual dies, but the sun itself
          shines without intermission, an eternal noon. Life is assured to
          the will to live; the form of life is an endless present, no matter
          how the individuals, the phenomena of the Idea, arise and pass away
          in time, like fleeting dreams. Thus even already suicide appears to
          us as a vain and therefore a foolish action; when we have carried
          our investigation further it will appear to us in a still less
          favourable light.
Dogmas change
          and our knowledge is deceptive; but Nature never errs, her
          procedure is sure, and she never conceals it. Everything is
          entirely in Nature, and Nature is entire in everything. She has her
          centre in every brute. It has surely found its way into existence,
          and it will surely find its way out of it. In the meantime it
          lives, fearless and without care, in the presence of annihilation,
          supported by the consciousness that it is Nature herself, and
          imperishable as she is. Man alone carries about with him, in
          abstract conceptions, the certainty of his death; yet this can only
          trouble him very rarely, [pg
          363]
          when for a single moment some occasion calls it up to his
          imagination. Against the mighty voice of Nature reflection can do
          little. In man, as in the brute which does not think, the certainty
          that springs from his inmost consciousness that he himself is
          Nature, the world, predominates as a lasting frame of mind; and on
          account of this no man is observably disturbed by the thought of
          certain and never-distant death, but lives as if he would live for
          ever. Indeed this is carried so far that we may say that no one has
          really a lively conviction of the certainty of his death, otherwise
          there would be no great difference between his frame of mind and
          that of a condemned criminal. Every one recognises that certainty
          in the abstract and theoretically, but lays it aside like other
          theoretical truths which are not applicable to practice, without
          really receiving it into his living consciousness. Whoever
          carefully considers this peculiarity of human character will see
          that the psychological explanations of it, from habit and
          acquiescence in the inevitable, are by no means sufficient, and
          that its true explanation lies in the deeper ground we have given.
          The same fact explains the circumstance that at all times and among
          all peoples dogmas of some kind or other relating to the continued
          existence of the individual after death arise, and are believed in,
          although the evidence in support of them must always be very
          insufficient, and the evidence against them forcible and varied.
          But, in truth, this really requires no proof, but is recognised by
          the healthy understanding as a fact, and confirmed by the
          confidence that Nature never lies any more than she errs, but
          openly exhibits and naïvely expresses her action and her nature,
          while only we ourselves obscure it by our folly, in order to
          establish what is agreeable to our limited point of view.
But this that we
          have brought to clearest consciousness, that although the
          particular phenomenon of the will has a temporal beginning and end,
          the will itself as thing-in-itself is not affected by it, nor yet
          the correlative of [pg
          364]
          all object, the knowing but never known subject, and that life is
          always assured to the will to live—this is not to be numbered with
          the doctrines of immortality. For permanence has no more to do with
          the will or with the pure subject of knowing, the eternal eye of
          the world, than transitoriness, for both are predicates that are
          only valid in time, and the will and the pure subject of knowing
          lie outside time. Therefore the egoism of the individual (this
          particular phenomenon of will enlightened by the subject of
          knowing) can extract as little nourishment and consolation for his
          wish to endure through endless time from the view we have
          expressed, as he could from the knowledge that after his death the
          rest of the eternal world would continue to exist, which is just
          the expression of the same view considered objectively, and
          therefore temporally. For every individual is transitory only as
          phenomenon, but as thing-in-itself is timeless, and therefore
          endless. But it is also only as phenomenon that an individual is
          distinguished from the other things of the world; as
          thing-in-itself he is the will which appears in all, and death
          destroys the illusion which separates his consciousness from that
          of the rest: this is immortality. His exemption from death, which
          belongs to him only as thing-in-itself, is for the phenomenon one
          with the immortality of the rest of the external world.67 Hence
          also, it arises that although the inward and merely felt
          consciousness of that which we have raised to distinct knowledge is
          indeed, as we have said, sufficient to prevent the thought of death
          from poisoning the life of the rational being, because this
          consciousness is the basis of that love of life which maintains
          everything living, and enables it to live on [pg 365] at ease as if there were no such thing
          as death, so long as it is face to face with life, and turns its
          attention to it, yet it will not prevent the individual from being
          seized with the fear of death, and trying in every way to escape
          from it, when it presents itself to him in some particular real
          case, or even only in his imagination, and he is compelled to
          contemplate it. For just as, so long as his knowledge was directed
          to life as such, he was obliged to recognise immortality in it, so
          when death is brought before his eyes, he is obliged to recognise
          it as that which it is, the temporal end of the particular temporal
          phenomenon. What we fear in death is by no means the pain, for it
          lies clearly on this side of death, and, moreover, we often take
          refuge in death from pain, just as, on the contrary, we sometimes
          endure the most fearful suffering merely to escape death for a
          while, although it would be quick and easy. Thus we distinguish
          pain and death as two entirely different evils. What we fear in
          death is the end of the individual, which it openly professes
          itself to be, and since the individual is a particular
          objectification of the will to live itself, its whole nature
          struggles against death. Now when feeling thus exposes us helpless,
          reason can yet step in and for the most part overcome its adverse
          influence, for it places us upon a higher standpoint, from which we
          no longer contemplate the particular but the whole. Therefore a
          philosophical knowledge of the nature of the world, which extended
          to the point we have now reached in this work but went no farther,
          could even at this point of view overcome the terror of death in
          the measure in which reflection had power over direct feeling in
          the given individual. A man who had thoroughly assimilated the
          truths we have already advanced, but had not come to know, either
          from his own experience or from a deeper insight, that constant
          suffering is essential to life, who found satisfaction and all that
          he wished in life, and could calmly and deliberately desire that
          his [pg 366] life, as he had
          hitherto known it, should endure for ever or repeat itself ever
          anew, and whose love of life was so great that he willingly and
          gladly accepted all the hardships and miseries to which it is
          exposed for the sake of its pleasures,—such a man would stand
          “with firm-knit bones on the well-rounded,
          enduring earth,” and would have nothing to fear. Armed with
          the knowledge we have given him, he would await with indifference
          the death that hastens towards him on the wings of time. He would
          regard it as a false illusion, an impotent spectre, which frightens
          the weak but has no power over him who knows that he is himself the
          will of which the whole world is the objectification or copy, and
          that therefore he is always certain of life, and also of the
          present, the peculiar and only form of the phenomenon of the will.
          He could not be terrified by an endless past or future in which he
          would not be, for this he would regard as the empty delusion of the
          web of Mâya. Thus he would no more fear death than the sun fears
          the night. In the “Bhagavad-Gita”
          Krishna thus raises the mind of his young pupil Arjuna, when,
          seized with compunction at the sight of the arrayed hosts (somewhat
          as Xerxes was), he loses heart and desires to give up the battle in
          order to avert the death of so many thousands. Krishna leads him to
          this point of view, and the death of those thousands can no longer
          restrain him; he gives the sign for battle. This point of view is
          also expressed by Goethe's Prometheus, especially when he says—



“Here
                sit I, form mankind


In my own image,


A race like to myself,


To suffer and to weep,


Rejoice, enjoy,


And heed thee not,


As I.”



The philosophy
          of Bruno and that of Spinoza might also lead any one to this point
          of view whose conviction was [pg 367] not shaken and weakened by their errors and
          imperfections. That of Bruno has properly no ethical theory at all,
          and the theory contained in the philosophy of Spinoza does not
          really proceed from the inner nature of his doctrine, but is merely
          tacked on to it by means of weak and palpable sophisms, though in
          itself it is praiseworthy and beautiful. Finally, there are many
          men who would occupy this point of view if their knowledge kept
          pace with their will, i.e., if, free from all
          illusion, they were in a position to become clearly and distinctly
          themselves. For this is, for knowledge, the point of view of the
          complete assertion of the will to live.
That the will
          asserts itself means, that while in its objectivity, i.e.,
          in the world and life, its own nature is completely and distinctly
          given it as idea, this knowledge does not by any means check its
          volition; but this very life, so known, is willed as such by the
          will with knowledge, consciously and deliberately, just as up to
          this point it willed it as blind effort without knowledge. The
          opposite of this, the denial of the will to live, shows
          itself if, when that knowledge is attained, volition ends, because
          the particular known phenomena no longer act as motives
          for willing, but the whole knowledge of the nature of the world,
          the mirror of the will, which has grown up through the
          comprehension of the Ideas, becomes a quieter
          of the will; and thus free, the will suppresses itself. These quite
          unfamiliar conceptions are difficult to understand when expressed
          in this general way, but it is hoped they will become clear through
          the exposition we shall give presently, with special reference to
          action, of the phenomena in which, on the one hand, the assertion
          in its different grades, and, on the other hand, the denial,
          expresses itself. For both proceed from knowledge, yet not from
          abstract knowledge, which is expressed in words, but from living
          knowledge, which is expressed in action and behaviour alone, and is
          independent of the dogmas which at the same time occupy the reason
          as abstract knowledge. To [pg
          368]
          exhibit them both, and bring them to distinct knowledge of the
          reason, can alone be my aim, and not to prescribe or recommend the
          one or the other, which would be as foolish as it would be useless;
          for the will in itself is absolutely free and entirely
          self-determining, and for it there is no law. But before we go on
          to the exposition referred to, we must first explain and more
          exactly define this freedom and its relation to
          necessity. And also, with regard to the life, the assertion and
          denial of which is our problem, we must insert a few general
          remarks connected with the will and its objects. Through all this
          we shall facilitate the apprehension of the inmost nature of the
          knowledge we are aiming at, of the ethical significance of methods
          of action.
Since, as has
          been said, this whole work is only the unfolding of a single
          thought, it follows that all its parts have the most intimate
          connection with each other. Not merely that each part stands in a
          necessary relation to what immediately precedes it, and only
          presupposes a recollection of that by the reader, as is the case
          with all philosophies which consist merely of a series of
          inferences, but that every part of the whole work is related to
          every other part and presupposes it. It is, therefore, necessary
          that the reader should remember not only what has just been said,
          but all the earlier parts of the work, so that he may be able to
          connect them with what he is reading, however much may have
          intervened. Plato also makes this demand upon his readers through
          the intricate digressions of his dialogues, in which he only
          returns to the leading thought after long episodes, which
          illustrate and explain it. In our case this demand is necessary;
          for the breaking up of our one single thought into its many aspects
          is indeed the only means of imparting it, though not essential to
          the thought itself, but merely an artificial form. The division of
          four principal points of view into four books, and the most careful
          bringing together of all that is related and homogeneous, assists
          the exposition [pg
          369]
          and its comprehension; yet the material absolutely does not admit
          of an advance in a straight line, such as the progress of history,
          but necessitates a more complicated exposition. This again makes a
          repeated study of the book necessary, for thus alone does the
          connection of all the parts with each other become distinct, and
          only then do they all mutually throw light upon each other and
          become quite clear.68
§ 55. That the
          will as such is free, follows from the fact that,
          according to our view, it is the thing-in-itself, the content of
          all phenomena. The phenomena, on the other hand, we recognise as
          absolutely subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason in its
          four forms. And since we know that necessity is throughout
          identical with following from given grounds, and that these are
          convertible conceptions, all that belongs to the phenomenon,
          i.e., all that is object for the
          knowing subject as individual, is in one aspect reason, and in
          another aspect consequent; and in this last capacity is determined
          with absolute necessity, and can, therefore, in no respect be other
          than it is. The whole content of Nature, the collective sum of its
          phenomena, is thus throughout necessary, and the necessity of every
          part, of every phenomenon, of every event, can always be proved,
          because it must be possible to find the reason from which it
          follows as a consequent. This admits of no exception: it follows
          from the unrestricted validity of the principle of sufficient
          reason. In another aspect, however, the same world is for us, in
          all its phenomena, objectivity of will. And the will, since it is
          not phenomenon, is not idea or object, but thing-in-itself, and is
          not subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason, the form of
          all object; thus is not determined as a consequent through any
          reason, knows no necessity, i.e., is free.
          The concept of freedom is thus [pg 370] properly a negative concept, for its content
          is merely the denial of necessity, i.e.,
          the relation of consequent to its reason, according to the
          principle of sufficient reason. Now here lies before us in its most
          distinct form the solution of that great contradiction, the union
          of freedom with necessity, which has so often been discussed in
          recent times, yet, so far as I know, never clearly and adequately.
          Everything is as phenomenon, as object, absolutely necessary:
          in
          itself it is will, which is perfectly free to all
          eternity. The phenomenon, the object, is necessarily and
          unalterably determined in that chain of causes and effects which
          admits of no interruption. But the existence in general of this
          object, and its specific nature, i.e.,
          the Idea which reveals itself in it, or, in other words, its
          character, is a direct manifestation of will. Thus, in conformity
          with the freedom of this will, the object might not be at all, or
          it might be originally and essentially something quite different
          from what it is, in which case, however, the whole chain of which
          it is a link, and which is itself a manifestation of the same will,
          would be quite different also. But once there and existing, it has
          entered the chain of causes and effects, is always necessarily
          determined in it, and can, therefore, neither become something
          else, i.e., change itself, nor yet
          escape from the chain, i.e., vanish. Man, like every
          other part of Nature, is objectivity of the will; therefore all
          that has been said holds good of him. As everything in Nature has
          its forces and qualities, which react in a definite way when
          definitely affected, and constitute its character, man also has his
          character, from which the motives
          call forth his actions with necessity. In this manner of conduct
          his empirical character reveals itself, but in this again his
          intelligible character, the will in itself, whose determined
          phenomenon he is. But man is the most complete phenomenon of will,
          and, as we explained in the Second Book, he had to be enlightened
          with so high a degree of knowledge [pg 371] in order to maintain himself in existence,
          that in it a perfectly adequate copy or repetition of the nature of
          the world under the form of the idea became possible: this is the
          comprehension of the Ideas, the pure mirror of the world, as we
          learnt in the Third Book. Thus in man the will can attain to full
          self-consciousness, to distinct and exhaustive knowledge of its own
          nature, as it mirrors itself in the whole world. We saw in the
          preceding book that art springs from the actual presence of this
          degree of knowledge; and at the end of our whole work it will
          further appear that, through the same knowledge, in that the will
          relates it to itself, a suppression and self-denial of the will in
          its most perfect manifestation is possible. So that the freedom
          which otherwise, as belonging to the thing-in-itself, can never
          show itself in the phenomenon, in such a case does also appear in
          it, and, by abolishing the nature which lies at the foundation of
          the phenomenon, while the latter itself still continues to exist in
          time, it brings about a contradiction of the phenomenon with
          itself, and in this way exhibits the phenomena of holiness and
          self-renunciation. But all this can only be fully understood at the
          end of this book. What has just been said merely affords a
          preliminary and general indication of how man is distinguished from
          all the other phenomena of will by the fact that freedom,
          i.e., independence of the
          principle of sufficient reason, which only belongs to the will as
          thing-in-itself, and contradicts the phenomenon, may yet possibly,
          in his case, appear in the phenomenon also, where, however, it
          necessarily exhibits itself as a contradiction of the phenomenon
          with itself. In this sense, not only the will in itself, but man
          also may certainly be called free, and thus distinguished from all
          other beings. But how this is to be understood can only become
          clear through all that is to follow, and for the present we must
          turn away from it altogether. For, in the first place, we must
          beware of the error that the action of the individual definite man
          is subject to no [pg
          372]
          necessity, i.e., that the power of the
          motive is less certain than the power of the cause, or the
          following of the conclusion from the premises. The freedom of the
          will as thing-in-itself, if, as has been said, we abstract from the
          entirely exceptional case mentioned above, by no means extends
          directly to its phenomenon, not even in the case in which this
          reaches the highest made of its visibility, and thus does not
          extend to the rational animal endowed with individual character,
          i.e., the person. The person is
          never free although he is the phenomenon of a free will; for he is
          already the determined phenomenon of the free volition of this
          will, and, because he enters the form of every object, the
          principle of sufficient reason, he develops indeed the unity of
          that will in a multiplicity of actions, but on account of the
          timeless unity of that volition in itself, this multiplicity
          exhibits in itself the regular conformity to law of a force of
          Nature. Since, however, it is that free volition that becomes
          visible in the person and the whole of his conduct, relating itself
          to him as the concept to the definition, every individual action of
          the person is to be ascribed to the free will, and directly
          proclaims itself as such in consciousness. Therefore, as was said
          in the Second Book, every one regards himself a priori (i.e.,
          here in this original feeling) as free in his individual actions,
          in the sense that in every given case every action is possible for
          him, and he only recognises a
          posteriori from experience and reflection upon
          experience that his actions take place with absolute necessity from
          the coincidence of his character with his motives. Hence it arises
          that every uncultured man, following his feeling, ardently defends
          complete freedom in particular actions, while the great thinkers of
          all ages, and indeed the more profound systems of religion, have
          denied it. But whoever has come to see clearly that the whole
          nature of man is will, and he himself only a phenomenon of this
          will, and that such a phenomenon has, even from the subject itself,
          the principle of sufficient reason as its [pg 373] necessary form, which here appears as the law
          of motivation,—such a man will regard it as just as absurd to doubt
          the inevitable nature of an action when the motive is presented to
          a given character, as to doubt that the three angles of any
          triangle are together equal to two right angles. Priestley has very
          sufficiently proved the necessity of the individual action in his
          “Doctrine of Philosophical
          Necessity;” but Kant, whose merit in this respect is
          specially great, first proved the coexistence of this necessity
          with the freedom of the will in itself, i.e.,
          apart from the phenomenon,69 by
          establishing the distinction between the intelligible and the
          empirical character. I entirely adhere to this distinction, for the
          former is the will as thing-in-itself so far as it appears in a
          definite individual in a definite grade, and the latter is this
          phenomenon itself as it exhibits itself in time in the mode of
          action, and in space in the physical structure. In order to make
          the relation of the two comprehensible, the best expression is that
          which I have already used in the introductory essay, that the
          intelligible character of every man is to be regarded as an act of
          will outside time, and therefore indivisible and unchangeable, and
          the manifestation of this act of will developed and broken up in
          time and space and all the forms of the principle of sufficient
          reason is the empirical character as it exhibits itself for
          experience in the whole conduct and life of this man. As the whole
          tree is only the constantly repeated manifestation of one and the
          same tendency, which exhibits itself in its simplest form in the
          fibre, and recurs and is easily recognised in the construction of
          the leaf, shoot, branch, and trunk, so all a man's deeds are merely
          the constantly repeated expression, somewhat varied in form, of his
          intelligible character, and the induction based on the sum of all
          these expressions gives us his empirical [pg 374] character. For the rest, I shall not at this
          point repeat in my own words Kant's masterly exposition, but
          presuppose it as known.
In the year 1840
          I dealt with the important chapter on the freedom of the will,
          thoroughly and in detail, in my crowned prize-essay upon the
          subject, and exposed the reason of the delusion which led men to
          imagine that they found an empirically given absolute freedom of
          the will, that is to say, a liberum arbitrium
          indifferentiæ, as a fact in self-consciousness; for
          the question propounded for the essay was with great insight
          directed to this point. Therefore, as I refer the reader to that
          work, and also to the tenth paragraph of the prize-essay on the
          basis of morals, which was published along with it under the title
          “The Two Fundamental Problems of
          Ethics,” I now omit the incomplete exposition of the
          necessity of the act of will, which was given at this place in the
          first edition. Instead of it I shall explain the delusion mentioned
          above in a brief discussion which is presupposed in the nineteenth
          chapter of the supplement to the present work, and therefore could
          not be given in the prize-essay referred to.
Apart from the
          fact that the will as the true thing-in-itself is actually original
          and independent, and that the feeling of its originality and
          absoluteness must accompany its acts in self-consciousness, though
          here they are already determined, there arises the illusion of an
          empirical freedom of the will (instead of the transcendental
          freedom which alone is to be attributed to it), and thus a freedom
          of its particular actions, from that attitude of the intellect
          towards the will which is explained, separated, and subordinated in
          the nineteenth chapter of the supplement, especially under No. 3.
          The intellect knows the conclusions of the will only a posteriori and empirically;
          therefore when a choice is presented, it has no data as to how the
          will is to decide. For the intelligible character, by virtue of
          which, when motives are given, only one
[pg 375] decision is possible
          and is therefore necessary, does not come within the knowledge of
          the intellect, but merely the empirical character is known to it
          through the succession of its particular acts. Therefore it seems
          to the intellect that in a given case two opposite decisions are
          possible for the will. But this is just the same thing as if we
          were to say of a perpendicular beam that has lost its balance, and
          is hesitating which way to fall, “It can
          fall either to the right hand or the left.” This can has
          merely a subjective significance, and really means “as far as the data known to us are concerned.”
          Objectively, the direction of the fall is necessarily determined as
          soon as the equilibrium is lost. Accordingly, the decision of one's
          own will is undetermined only to the beholder, one's own intellect,
          and thus merely relatively and subjectively for the subject of
          knowing. In itself and objectively, on the other hand, in every
          choice presented to it, its decision is at once determined and
          necessary. But this determination only comes into consciousness
          through the decision that follows upon it. Indeed, we receive an
          empirical proof of this when any difficult and important choice
          lies before us, but only under a condition which is not yet
          present, but merely hoped for, so that in the meanwhile we can do
          nothing, but must remain passive. Now we consider how we shall
          decide when the circumstances occur that will give us a free
          activity and choice. Generally the foresight of rational
          deliberation recommends one decision, while direct inclination
          leans rather to the other. So long as we are compelled to remain
          passive, the side of reason seems to wish to keep the upper hand;
          but we see beforehand how strongly the other side will influence us
          when the opportunity for action arises. Till then we are eagerly
          concerned to place the motives on both sides in the clearest light,
          by calm meditation on the pro et
          contra, so that every motive may exert its full
          influence upon the will when the time arrives, and it may not be
          misled by a [pg
          376]
          mistake on the part of the intellect to decide otherwise than it
          would have done if all the motives had their due influence upon it.
          But this distinct unfolding of the motives on both sides is all
          that the intellect can do to assist the choice. It awaits the real
          decision just as passively and with the same intense curiosity as
          if it were that of a foreign will. Therefore from its point of view
          both decisions must seem to it equally possible; and this is just
          the illusion of the empirical freedom of the will. Certainly the
          decision enters the sphere of the intellect altogether empirically,
          as the final conclusion of the matter; but yet it proceeded from
          the inner nature, the intelligible character, of the individual
          will in its conflict with given motives, and therefore with
          complete necessity. The intellect can do nothing more than bring
          out clearly and fully the nature of the motives; it cannot
          determine the will itself; for the will is quite inaccessible to
          it, and, as we have seen, cannot be investigated.
If, under the
          same circumstances, a man could act now one way and now another, it
          would be necessary that his will itself should have changed in the
          meantime, and thus that it should lie in time, for change is only
          possible in time; but then either the will would be a mere
          phenomenon, or time would be a condition of the thing-in-itself.
          Accordingly the dispute as to the freedom of the particular action,
          the liberum arbitrium
          indifferentiæ, really turns on the question whether
          the will lies in time or not. If, as both Kant's doctrine and the
          whole of my system necessitates, the will is the thing-in-itself
          outside time and outside every form of the principle of sufficient
          reason, not only must the individual act in the same way in the
          same circumstances, and not only must every bad action be the sure
          warrant of innumerable others, which the individual must
          perform and cannot leave, but, as Kant said,
          if only the empirical character and the motives were completely
          given, it would be possible to calculate the future conduct of a
          man just as we can calculate an [pg 377] eclipse of the sun or moon. As Nature is
          consistent, so is the character; every action must take place in
          accordance with it, just as every phenomenon takes place according
          to a law of Nature: the causes in the latter case and the motives
          in the former are merely the occasional causes, as was shown in the
          Second Book. The will, whose phenomenon is the whole being and life
          of man, cannot deny itself in the particular case, and what the man
          wills on the whole, that will he also will in the particular
          case.
The assertion of
          an empirical freedom of the will, a liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ,
          agrees precisely with the doctrine that places the inner nature of
          man in a soul, which is originally a
          knowing, and indeed really an
          abstract thinking nature, and only in
          consequence of this a willing nature—a doctrine which
          thus regards the will as of a secondary or derivative nature,
          instead of knowledge which is really so. The will indeed came to be
          regarded as an act of thought, and to be identified with the
          judgment, especially by Descartes and Spinoza. According to this
          doctrine every man must become what he is only through his
          knowledge; he must enter the world as a moral cipher come to know
          the things in it, and thereupon determine to be this or that, to
          act thus or thus, and may also through new knowledge achieve a new
          course of action, that is to say, become another person. Further,
          he must first know a thing to be good,
          and in consequence of this will it, instead of first willing
          it, and in consequence of this calling it good.
          According to my fundamental point of view, all this is a reversal
          of the true relation. Will is first and original; knowledge is
          merely added to it as an instrument belonging to the phenomenon of
          will. Therefore every man is what he is through his will, and his
          character is original, for willing is the basis of his nature.
          Through the knowledge which is added to it he comes to know in the
          course of experience what he is, i.e.,
          he learns his [pg
          378]
          character. Thus he knows himself in consequence of
          and in accordance with the nature of his will, instead of
          willing in consequence of and in
          accordance with his knowing. According to the latter view, he would
          only require to consider how he would like best to be, and he would
          be it; that is its doctrine of the freedom of the will. Thus it
          consists really in this, that a man is his own work guided by the
          light of knowledge. I, on the contrary, say that he is his own work
          before all knowledge, and knowledge is merely added to it to
          enlighten it. Therefore he cannot resolve to be this or that, nor
          can he become other than he is; but he is once
          for all, and he knows in the course of experience what he
          is. According to one doctrine he wills
          what he knows, and according to the other he knows
          what he wills.
The Greeks
          called the character ηθος, and its expression, i.e.,
          morals, ηθη. But this word comes from εθος, custom; they chose it
          in order to express metaphorically the constancy of character
          through the constancy of custom. Το γαρ ηθος απο του εθους εχει την
          επωνυμιαν. ηθικε γαρ καλειται δια το εθιζεσθαι (a voce ηθος, i.e.,
          consuetudo ηθος est appellatum: ethica ergo dicta
          est απο του εθιζεσθαι, sivi ab assuescendo) says
          Aristotle (Eth. Magna, i. 6, p. 1186, and Eth. Eud., p. 1220, and
          Eth. Nic., p. 1103, ed. Ber.) Stobæus quotes: οἱ δε κατα Ζηνωνα
          τροπικως; ηθος εστι πηγη βιου αφ᾽ ἡς αἱ κατα μερος πραξεις ρεουσι
          (Stoici autem, Zenonis castra sequentes,
          metaphorice ethos definiunt vitæ fontem, e quo singulæ manant
          actiones), ii. ch. 7. In Christian theology we find
          the dogma of predestination in consequence of election and
          non-election (Rom. ix. 11-24), clearly originating from the
          knowledge that man does not change himself, but his life and
          conduct, i.e., his empirical character,
          is only the unfolding of his intelligible character, the
          development of decided and unchangeable natural dispositions
          recognisable even in the child; therefore, as it were, even at his
          birth his conduct is firmly determined, and [pg 379] remains essentially the same to the
          end. This we entirely agree with; but certainly the consequences
          which followed from the union of this perfectly correct insight
          with the dogmas that already existed in Jewish theology, and which
          now gave rise to the great difficulty, the Gordian knot upon which
          most of the controversies of the Church turned, I do not undertake
          to defend, for even the Apostle Paul scarcely succeeded in doing so
          by means of his simile of the potter's vessels which he invented
          for the purpose, for the result he finally arrived at was nothing
          else than this:—



“Let
                mankind


Fear the gods!


They hold the power


In everlasting hands:


And they can use it


As seems good to them.”



Such
          considerations, however, are really foreign to our subject. Some
          explanation as to the relation between the character and the
          knowledge in which all its motives lie, will now be more to the
          point.
The motives
          which determine the manifestation of the character or conduct
          influence it through the medium of knowledge. But knowledge is
          changeable, and often vacillates between truth and error, yet, as a
          rule, is rectified more and more in the course of life, though
          certainly in very different degrees. Therefore the conduct of a man
          may be observably altered without justifying us in concluding that
          his character has been changed. What the man really and in general
          wills, the striving of his inmost nature, and the end he pursues in
          accordance with it, this we can never change by influence upon him
          from without by instruction, otherwise we could transform him.
          Seneca says admirably, velle non
          discitur; whereby he preferred truth to his Stoic
          philosophers, who taught διδακτην ειναι την αρετην (doceri posse virtutem). From
          without the will can only be affected by motives. But [pg 380] these can never change the will itself;
          for they have power over it only under the presupposition that it
          is precisely such as it is. All that they can do is thus to alter
          the direction of its effort, i.e., bring it about that it
          shall seek in another way than it has hitherto done that which it
          invariably seeks. Therefore instruction, improved knowledge, in
          other words, influence from without, may indeed teach the will that
          it erred in the means it employed, and can therefore bring it about
          that the end after which it strives once for all according to its
          inner nature shall be pursued on an entirely different path and in
          an entirely different object from what has hitherto been the case.
          But it can never bring about that the will shall will something
          actually different from what it has hitherto willed; this remains
          unchangeable, for the will is simply this willing itself, which
          would have to be abolished. The former, however, the possible
          modification of knowledge, and through knowledge of conduct,
          extends so far that the will seeks to attain its unalterable end,
          for example, Mohammed's paradise, at one time in the real world, at
          another time in a world of imagination, adapting the means to each,
          and thus in the first case applying prudence, might, and fraud, and
          in the second case, abstinence, justice, alms, and pilgrimages to
          Mecca. But its effort itself has not therefore changed, still less
          the will itself. Thus, although its action certainly shows itself
          very different at different times, its willing has yet remained
          precisely the same. Velle non
          discitur.
For motives to
          act, it is necessary not only that they should be present, but that
          they should be known; for, according to a very good expression of
          the schoolmen, which we referred to once before, causa finalis movet non secundum suum esse
          reale; sed secundum esse cognitum. For example, in
          order that the relation may appear that exists in a given man
          between egoism and sympathy, it is not sufficient that he should
          possess wealth [pg
          381]
          and see others in want, but he must also know what he can do with
          his wealth, both for himself and for others: not only must the
          suffering of others be presented to him, but he must know both what
          suffering and also what pleasure is. Perhaps, on a first occasion,
          he did not know all this so well as on a second; and if, on a
          similar occasion, he acts differently, this arises simply from the
          fact that the circumstances were really different, as regards the
          part of them that depends on his knowing them, although they seem
          to be the same. As ignorance of actually existing circumstances
          robs them of their influence, so, on the other hand, entirely
          imaginary circumstances may act as if they were real, not only in
          the case of a particular deception, but also in general and
          continuously. For example, if a man is firmly persuaded that every
          good action will be repaid him a hundredfold in a future life, such
          a conviction affects him in precisely the same way as a good bill
          of exchange at a very long date, and he can give from mere egoism,
          as from another point of view he would take from egoism. He has not
          changed himself: velle non
          discitur. It is on account of this great influence of
          knowledge upon action, while the will remains unchangeable, that
          the character develops and its different features appear only
          little by little. Therefore it shows itself different at every
          period of life, and an impetuous, wild youth may be succeeded by a
          staid, sober, manly age. Especially what is bad in the character
          will always come out more strongly with time, yet sometimes it
          occurs that passions which a man gave way to in his youth are
          afterwards voluntarily restrained, simply because the motives
          opposed to them have only then come into knowledge. Hence, also, we
          are all innocent to begin with, and this merely means that neither
          we nor others know the evil of our own nature; it only appears with
          the motives, and only in time do the motives appear in knowledge.
          [pg 382] Finally we come to
          know ourselves as quite different from what a
          priori we supposed ourselves to be, and then we are
          often terrified at ourselves.
Repentance never
          proceeds from a change of the will (which is impossible), but from
          a change of knowledge. The essential and peculiar in what I have
          always willed I must still continue to will; for I myself am this
          will which lies outside time and change. I can therefore never
          repent of what I have willed, though I can repent of what I have
          done; because, led by false conceptions, I did something that was
          not in conformity with my will. The discovery of this through
          fuller knowledge is repentance. This extends not
          merely to worldly wisdom, to the choice of the means, and the
          judgment of the appropriateness of the end to my own will, but also
          to what is properly ethical. For example, I may have acted more
          egotistically than is in accordance with my character, led astray
          by exaggerated ideas of the need in which I myself stood, or of the
          craft, falseness, and wickedness of others, or because I hurried
          too much, i.e., acted without
          deliberation, determined not by motives distinctly known
          in abstracto, but by merely
          perceived motives, by the present and the emotion which it excited,
          and which was so strong that I had not properly the use of my
          reason; but the return of reflection is thus here also merely
          corrected knowledge, and from this repentance may proceed, which
          always proclaims itself by making amends for the past, as far as is
          possible. Yet it must be observed that, in order to deceive
          themselves, men prearrange what seem to be hasty errors, but are
          really secretly considered actions. For we deceive and flatter no
          one through such fine devices as ourselves. The converse of the
          case we have given may also occur. I may be misled by too good an
          opinion of others, or want of knowledge of the relative value of
          the good things of life, or some abstract dogma in which I have
          since lost faith, and thus I may act less egotistically than is in
          [pg 383] keeping with my
          character, and lay up for myself repentance of another kind. Thus
          repentance is always corrected knowledge of the relation of an act
          to its special intention. When the will reveals its Ideas in space
          alone, i.e., through mere form, the
          matter in which other Ideas—in this case natural forces—already
          reign, resists the will, and seldom allows the form that is
          striving after visibility to appear in perfect purity and
          distinctness, i.e., in perfect beauty. And
          there is an analogous hindrance to the will as it reveals itself in
          time alone, i.e., through actions, in the
          knowledge which seldom gives it the data quite correctly, so that
          the action which takes place does not accurately correspond to the
          will, and leads to repentance. Repentance thus always proceeds from
          corrected knowledge, not from the change of the will, which is
          impossible. Anguish of conscience for past deeds is anything but
          repentance. It is pain at the knowledge of oneself in one's inmost
          nature, i.e., as will. It rests
          precisely on the certainty that we have still the same will. If the
          will were changed, and therefore the anguish of conscience mere
          repentance, it would cease to exist. The past could then no longer
          give us pain, for it exhibited the expressions of a will which is
          no longer that of him who has repented. We shall explain the
          significance of anguish of conscience in detail farther on.
The influence
          which knowledge, as the medium of motives, exerts, not indeed upon
          the will itself, but upon its appearance in actions, is also the
          source of the principal distinction between the action of men and
          that of brutes, for their methods of knowledge are different. The
          brute has only knowledge of perception, the man, through reason,
          has also abstract ideas, conceptions. Now, although man and brute
          are with equal necessity determined by their motives, yet man, as
          distinguished from the brute, has a complete choice,
          which has often been regarded as a freedom of the will in
          particular actions, although it is nothing but the possibility of a
          [pg 384]
          thoroughly-fought-out battle between several motives, the strongest
          of which then determines it with necessity. For this the motives
          must have assumed the form of abstract thoughts, because it is
          really only by means of these that deliberation, i.e., a
          weighing of opposite reasons for action, is possible. In the case
          of the brute there can only be a choice between perceptible motives
          presented to it, so that the choice is limited to the narrow sphere
          of its present sensuous perception. Therefore the necessity of the
          determination of the will by the motive, which is like that of the
          effect by the cause, can be exhibited perceptibly and directly only
          in the case of the brutes, because here the spectator has the
          motives just as directly before his eyes as their effect; while in
          the case of man the motives are almost always abstract ideas, which
          are not communicated to the spectator, and even for the actor
          himself the necessity of their effect is hidden behind their
          conflict. For only in
          abstracto can several ideas, as judgments and chains
          of conclusions, lie beside each other in consciousness, and then,
          free from all determination of time, work against each other till
          the stronger overcomes the rest and determines the will. This is
          the complete choice or power of deliberation
          which man has as distinguished from the brutes, and on account of
          which freedom of the will has been attributed to him, in the belief
          that his willing is a mere result of the operations of his
          intellect, without a definite tendency which serves as its basis;
          while, in truth, the motives only work on the foundation and under
          the presupposition of his definite tendency, which in his case is
          individual, i.e., a character. A fuller
          exposition of this power of deliberation, and the difference
          between human and brute choice which is introduced by it, will be
          found in the “Two Fundamental Problems of
          Ethics” (1st edition, p. 35, et
          seq.; 2d edition, p. 34, et
          seq.), to which I therefore refer. For the rest, this
          power of deliberation which man possesses is one of those things
          that makes his [pg
          385]
          existence so much more miserable than that of the brute. For in
          general our greatest sufferings do not lie in the present as ideas
          of perception or as immediate feelings; but in the reason, as
          abstract conceptions, painful thoughts, from which the brute, which
          lives only in the present, and therefore in enviable carelessness,
          is entirely free.
It seems to have
          been the dependence, which we have shown, of the human power of
          deliberation upon the faculty of abstract thinking, and thus also
          of judging and drawing conclusions also, that led both Descartes
          and Spinoza to identify the decisions of the will with the faculty
          of asserting and denying (the faculty of judgment). From this
          Descartes deduced the doctrine that the will, which, according to
          him, is indifferently free, is the source of sin, and also of all
          theoretical error. And Spinoza, on the other hand, concluded that
          the will is necessarily determined by the motives, as the judgment
          is by the reasons.70 The
          latter doctrine is in a sense true, but it appears as a true
          conclusion from false premises.
The distinction
          we have established between the ways in which the brutes and man
          are respectively moved by motives exerts a very wide influence upon
          the nature of both, and has most to do with the complete and
          obvious differences of their existence. While an idea of perception
          is in every case the motive which determines the brute, the man
          strives to exclude this kind of motivation altogether, and to
          determine himself entirely by abstract ideas. Thus he uses his
          prerogative of reason to the greatest possible advantage.
          Independent of the present, he neither chooses nor avoids the
          passing pleasure or pain, but reflects on the consequences of both.
          In most cases, setting aside quite insignificant actions, we are
          determined by abstract, thought motives, not present impressions.
          Therefore all particular privation for the moment is for us
          comparatively light, but all renunciation is terribly [pg 386] hard; for the former only concerns the
          fleeting present, but the latter concerns the future, and includes
          in itself innumerable privations, of which it is the equivalent.
          The causes of our pain, as of our pleasure, lie for the most part,
          not in the real present, but merely in abstract thoughts. It is
          these which are often unbearable to us—inflict torments in
          comparison with which all the sufferings of the animal world are
          very small; for even our own physical pain is not felt at all when
          they are present. Indeed, in the case of keen mental suffering, we
          even inflict physical suffering on ourselves merely to distract our
          attention from the former to the latter. This is why, in great
          mental anguish, men tear their hair, beat their breasts, lacerate
          their faces, or roll on the floor, for all these are in reality
          only violent means of diverting the mind from an unbearable
          thought. Just because mental pain, being much greater, makes us
          insensible to physical pain, suicide is very easy to the person who
          is in despair, or who is consumed by morbid depression, even though
          formerly, in comfortable circumstances, he recoiled at the thought
          of it. In the same way care and passion (thus the play of thought)
          wear out the body oftener and more than physical hardships. And in
          accordance with this Epictetus rightly says: Ταρασσει τους
          ανθρωπους ου τα πραγματα, αλλα τα περι των πραγματων δογματα
          (Perturbant homines non res ipsæ, sed de rebus
          decreta) (V.); and Seneca: Plura sunt quæ nos terrent, quam quæ premunt,
          et sæpius opinione quam re laboramus (Ep. 5).
          Eulenspiegel also admirably bantered human nature, for going uphill
          he laughed, and going downhill he wept. Indeed, children who have
          hurt themselves often cry, not at the pain, but at the thought of
          the pain which is awakened when some one condoles with them. Such
          great differences in conduct and in life arise from the diversity
          between the methods of knowledge of the brutes and man. Further,
          the appearance of the distinct and decided individual character,
          the [pg 387] principal
          distinction between man and the brute, which has scarcely more than
          the character of the species, is conditioned by the choice between
          several motives, which is only possible through abstract
          conceptions. For only after a choice has been made are the
          resolutions, which vary in different individuals, an indication of
          the individual character which is different in each; while the
          action of the brute depends only upon the presence or absence of
          the impression, supposing this impression to be in general a motive
          for its species. And, finally, in the case of man, only the
          resolve, and not the mere wish, is a valid indication of his
          character both for himself and for others; but the resolve becomes
          for himself, as for others, a certain fact only through the deed.
          The wish is merely the necessary consequence of the present
          impression, whether of the outward stimulus, or the inward passing
          mood; and is therefore as immediately necessary and devoid of
          consideration as the action of the brutes. Therefore, like the
          action of the brutes, it merely expresses the character of the
          species, not that of the individual, i.e.,
          it indicates merely what man in general, not what the
          individual who experiences the wish, is capable of doing. The deed
          alone,—because as human action it always requires a certain
          deliberation, and because as a rule a man has command of his
          reason, is considerate, i.e., decides in accordance with
          considered and abstract motives,—is the expression of the
          intelligible maxims of his conduct, the result of his inmost
          willing, and is related as a letter to the word that stands for his
          empirical character, itself merely the temporal expression of his
          intelligible character. In a healthy mind, therefore, only deeds
          oppress the conscience, not wishes and thoughts; for it is only our
          deeds that hold up to us the mirror of our will. The deed referred
          to above, that is entirely unconsidered and is really committed in
          blind passion, is to a certain extent an intermediate thing between
          the mere wish and the resolve.[pg 388]
Therefore, by
          true repentance, which, however, shows itself as action also, it
          can be obliterated, as a falsely drawn line, from that picture of
          our will which our course of life is. I may insert the remark here,
          as a very good comparison, that the relation between wish and deed
          has a purely accidental but accurate analogy with that between the
          accumulation and discharge of electricity.
As the result of
          the whole of this discussion of the freedom of the will and what
          relates to it, we find that although the will may, in itself and
          apart from the phenomenon, be called free and even omnipotent, yet
          in its particular phenomena enlightened by knowledge, as in men and
          brutes, it is determined by motives to which the special character
          regularly and necessarily responds, and always in the same way. We
          see that because of the possession on his part of abstract or
          rational knowledge, man, as distinguished from the brutes, has a
          choice, which only makes him the
          scene of the conflict of his motives, without withdrawing him from
          their control. This choice is therefore certainly the condition of
          the possibility of the complete expression of the individual
          character, but is by no means to be regarded as freedom of the
          particular volition, i.e., independence of the law of
          causality, the necessity of which extends to man as to every other
          phenomenon. Thus the difference between human volition and that of
          the brutes, which is introduced by reason or knowledge through
          concepts, extends to the point we have indicated, and no farther.
          But, what is quite a different thing, there may arise a phenomenon
          of the human will which is quite impossible in the brute creation,
          if man altogether lays aside the knowledge of particular things as
          such which is subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason,
          and by means of his knowledge of the Ideas sees through the
          principium individuationis. Then
          an actual appearance of the real freedom of the will as a
          thing-in-itself is possible, by which the phenomenon comes into a
          sort of contradiction with [pg 389] itself, as is indicated by the word
          self-renunciation; and, finally, the “in-itself” of its nature suppresses itself. But
          this, the one, real, and direct expression of the freedom of the
          will in itself in the phenomenon, cannot be distinctly explained
          here, but will form the subject of the concluding part of our
          work.
Now that we have
          shown clearly in these pages the unalterable nature of the
          empirical character, which is just the unfolding of the
          intelligible character that lies outside time, together with the
          necessity with which actions follow upon its contact with motives,
          we hasten to anticipate an argument which may very easily be drawn
          from this in the interest of bad dispositions. Our character is to
          be regarded as the temporal unfolding of an extra-temporal, and
          therefore indivisible and unalterable, act of will, or an
          intelligible character. This necessarily determines all that is
          essential in our conduct in life, i.e.,
          its ethical content, which must express itself in accordance with
          it in its phenomenal appearance, the empirical character; while
          only what is unessential in this, the outward form of our course of
          life, depends upon the forms in which the motives present
          themselves. It might, therefore, be inferred that it is a waste of
          trouble to endeavour to improve one's character, and that it is
          wiser to submit to the inevitable, and gratify every inclination at
          once, even if it is bad. But this is precisely the same thing as
          the theory of an inevitable fate which is called αργος λογος, and
          in more recent times Turkish faith. Its true refutation, as it is
          supposed to have been given by Chrysippus, is explained by Cicero
          in his book De Fato, ch. 12, 13.
Though
          everything may be regarded as irrevocably predetermined by fate,
          yet it is so only through the medium of the chain of causes;
          therefore in no case can it be determined that an effect shall
          appear without its cause. Thus it is not simply the event that is
          [pg 390] predetermined, but
          the event as the consequence of preceding causes; so that fate does
          not decide the consequence alone, but also the means as the
          consequence of which it is destined to appear. Accordingly, if some
          means is not present, it is certain that the consequence also will
          not be present: each is always present in accordance with the
          determination of fate, but this is never known to us till
          afterwards.
As events always
          take place according to fate, i.e., according to the infinite
          concatenation of causes, so our actions always take place according
          to our intelligible character. But just as we do not know the
          former beforehand, so no a
          priori insight is given us into the latter, but we
          only come to know ourselves as we come to know other persons
          a posteriori through experience.
          If the intelligible character involved that we could only form a
          good resolution after a long conflict with a bad disposition, this
          conflict would have to come first and be waited for. Reflection on
          the unalterable nature of the character, on the unity of the source
          from which all our actions flow, must not mislead us into claiming
          the decision of the character in favour of one side or the other;
          it is in the resolve that follows that we shall see what manner of
          men we are, and mirror ourselves in our actions. This is the
          explanation of the satisfaction or the anguish of soul with which
          we look back on the course of our past life. Both are experienced,
          not because these past deeds have still an existence; they are
          past, they have been, and now are no more; but their great
          importance for us lies in their significance, lies in the fact that
          these deeds are the expression of the character, the mirror of the
          will, in which we look and recognise our inmost self, the kernel of
          our will. Because we experience this not before, but only after, it
          behoves us to strive and fight in time, in order that the picture
          we produce by our deeds may be such that the contemplation of it
          may calm us as much as possible, instead of harassing us. The
          significance of [pg
          391]
          this consolation or anguish of soul will, as we have said, be
          inquired into farther on; but to this place there belongs the
          inquiry which follows, and which stands by itself.
Besides the
          intelligible and the empirical character, we must mention a third
          which is different from them both, the acquired
          character, which one only receives in life through
          contact with the world, and which is referred to when one is
          praised as a man of character or censured as being without
          character. Certainly one might suppose that, since the empirical
          character, as the phenomenon of the intelligible, is unalterable,
          and, like every natural phenomenon, is consistent with itself, man
          would always have to appear like himself and consistent, and would
          therefore have no need to acquire a character artificially by
          experience and reflection. But the case is otherwise, and although
          a man is always the same, yet he does not always understand
          himself, but often mistakes himself, till he has in some degree
          acquired real self-knowledge. The empirical character, as a mere
          natural tendency, is in itself irrational; nay, more, its
          expressions are disturbed by reason, all the more so the more
          intellect and power of thought the man has; for these always keep
          before him what becomes man in general as the character of
          the species, and what is possible for him both in will and in deed.
          This makes it the more difficult for him to see how much his
          individuality enables him to will and to accomplish. He finds in
          himself the germs of all the various human pursuits and powers, but
          the difference of degree in which they exist in his individuality
          is not clear to him in the absence of experience; and if he now
          applies himself to the pursuits which alone correspond to his
          character, he yet feels, especially at particular moments and in
          particular moods, the inclination to directly opposite pursuits
          which cannot be combined with them, but must be entirely suppressed
          if he desires to follow the former undisturbed. For as our physical
          path upon earth is always [pg
          392]
          merely a line, not an extended surface, so in life, if we desire to
          grasp and possess one thing, we must renounce and leave innumerable
          others on the right hand and on the left. If we cannot make up our
          minds to this, but, like children at the fair, snatch at everything
          that attracts us in passing, we are making the perverse endeavour
          to change the line of our path into an extended surface; we run in
          a zigzag, skip about like a will o' the wisp, and attain to
          nothing. Or, to use another comparison, as, according to Hobbes'
          philosophy of law, every one has an original right to everything
          but an exclusive right to nothing, yet can obtain an exclusive
          right to particular things by renouncing his right to all the rest,
          while others, on their part, do likewise with regard to what he has
          chosen; so is it in life, in which some definite pursuit, whether
          it be pleasure, honour, wealth, science, art, or virtue, can only
          be followed with seriousness and success when all claims that are
          foreign to it are given up, when everything else is renounced.
          Accordingly, the mere will and the mere ability are not sufficient,
          but a man must also know what he wills, and know
          what he can do; only then will he show character, and only then can
          he accomplish something right. Until he attains to that,
          notwithstanding the natural consistency of the empirical character,
          he is without character. And although, on the whole, he must remain
          true to himself, and fulfil his course, led by his dæmon, yet his
          path will not be a straight line, but wavering and uneven. He will
          hesitate, deviate, turn back, lay up for himself repentance and
          pain. And all this is because, in great and small, he sees before
          him all that is possible and attainable for man in general, but
          does not know what part of all this is alone suitable for him, can
          be accomplished by him, and is alone enjoyable by him. He will,
          therefore, envy many men on account of a position and circumstances
          which are yet only suitable to their characters and not to his, and
          in which he would feel unhappy, if indeed he found [pg 393] them endurable at all. For as a fish is
          only at home in water, a bird in the air, a mole in the earth, so
          every man is only at home in the atmosphere suitable to him. For
          example, not all men can breathe the air of court life. From
          deficiency of proper insight into all this, many a man will make
          all kinds of abortive attempts, will do violence to his character
          in particulars, and yet, on the whole, will have to yield to it
          again; and what he thus painfully attains will give him no
          pleasure; what he thus learns will remain dead; even in an ethical
          regard, a deed that is too noble for his character, that has not
          sprung from pure, direct impulse, but from a concept, a dogma, will
          lose all merit, even in his own eyes, through subsequent egoistical
          repentance. Velle non
          discitur. We only become conscious of the
          inflexibility of another person's character through experience, and
          till then we childishly believe that it is possible, by means of
          rational ideas, by prayers and entreaties, by example and
          noble-mindedness, ever to persuade any one to leave his own way, to
          change his course of conduct, to depart from his mode of thinking,
          or even to extend his capacities: so is it also with ourselves. We
          must first learn from experience what we desire and what we can do.
          Till then we know it not, we are without character, and must often
          be driven back to our own way by hard blows from without. But if we
          have finally learnt it, then we have attained to what in the world
          is called character, the acquired character. This is
          accordingly nothing but the most perfect knowledge possible of our
          own individuality. It is the abstract, and consequently distinct,
          knowledge of the unalterable qualities of our own empirical
          character, and of the measure and direction of our mental and
          physical powers, and thus of the whole strength and weakness of our
          own individuality. This places us in a position to carry out
          deliberately and methodically the rôle which belongs to our own
          person, and to fill up the gaps which caprices or weaknesses
          [pg 394] produce in it, under
          the guidance of fixed conceptions. This rôle is in itself
          unchangeably determined once for all, but hitherto we have allowed
          it to follow its natural course without any rule. We have now
          brought to distinct conscious maxims which are always present to us
          the form of conduct which is necessarily determined by our own
          individual nature, and now we conduct it in accordance with them as
          deliberately as if we had learned it; without ever falling into
          error through the passing influence of the mood or the impression
          of the present, without being checked by the bitterness or
          sweetness of some particular thing we meet with on our path,
          without delay, without hesitation, without inconsistency. We shall
          now no longer, as novices, wait, attempt, and grope about in order
          to see what we really desire and are able to do, but we know this
          once for all, and in every choice we have only to apply general
          principles to particular cases, and arrive at once at a decision.
          We know our will in general, and do not allow ourselves to be led
          by the passing mood or by solicitations from without to resolve in
          particular cases what is contrary to it as a whole. We know in the
          same way the nature and the measure of our strength and our
          weakness, and thereby are spared much suffering. For we experience
          no real pleasure except in the use and feeling of our own powers,
          and the greatest pain is the conscious deficiency of our powers
          where we need them. If, now, we have discovered where our strength
          and our weakness lie, we will endeavour to cultivate, employ, and
          in every way make use of those talents which are naturally
          prominent in us. We will always turn to those occupations in which
          they are valuable and to the purpose, and entirely avoid, even with
          self-renunciation, those pursuits for which we have naturally
          little aptitude; we will beware of attempting that in which we have
          no chance of succeeding. Only he who has attained to this will
          constantly and with [pg
          395]
          full consciousness be completely himself, and will never fail
          himself at the critical moment, because he will always have known
          what he could expect from himself. He will often enjoy the
          satisfaction of feeling his strength, and seldom experience the
          pain of being reminded of his weakness. The latter is
          mortification, which causes perhaps the greatest of mental
          sufferings; therefore it is far more endurable to have our
          misfortune brought clearly before us than our incapacity. And,
          further, if we are thus fully acquainted with our strength and our
          weakness, we will not attempt to make a show of powers which we do
          not possess; we will not play with base coin, for all such
          dissimulation misses the mark in the end. For since the whole man
          is only the phenomenon of his will, nothing can be more perverse
          than to try, by means of reflection, to become something else than
          one is, for this is a direct contradiction of the will with itself.
          The imitation of the qualities and idiosyncrasies of others is much
          more shameful than to dress in other people's clothes; for it is
          the judgment of our own worthlessness pronounced by ourselves.
          Knowledge of our own mind and its capacities of every kind, and
          their unalterable limits, is in this respect the surest way to the
          attainment of the greatest possible contentment with ourselves. For
          it holds good of inward as of outward circumstances that there is
          for us no consolation so effective as the complete certainty of
          unalterable necessity. No evil that befalls us pains us so much as
          the thought of the circumstances by which it might have been warded
          off. Therefore nothing comforts us so effectually as the
          consideration of what has happened from the standpoint of
          necessity, from which all accidents appear as tools in the hand of
          an overruling fate, and we therefore recognise the evil that has
          come to us as inevitably produced by the conflict of inner and
          outer circumstances; in other words, fatalism. We really only
          complain and storm so long as we hope [pg 396] either to affect others or to excite
          ourselves to unheard-of efforts. But children and grown-up people
          know very well to yield contentedly as soon as they clearly see
          that it absolutely cannot be otherwise:—Θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλον
          δαμάσσαντες ἀνάγκη (Animo in pectoribus
          nostro domito necessitate). We are like the entrapped
          elephants, that rage and struggle for many days, till they see that
          it is useless, and then suddenly offer their necks quietly to the
          yoke, tamed for ever. We are like King David, who, as long as his
          son still lived, unceasingly importuned Jehovah with prayers, and
          behaved himself as if in despair; but as soon as his son was dead,
          thought no longer about it. Hence it arises that innumerable
          permanent ills, such as lameness, poverty, low estate, ugliness, a
          disagreeable dwelling-place, are borne with indifference by
          innumerable persons, and are no longer felt, like healed wounds,
          just because these persons know that inward or outward necessity
          renders it impossible that any change can take place in these
          things; while those who are more fortunate cannot understand how
          such misfortunes can be borne. Now as with outward necessity, so
          also with inward; nothing reconciles so thoroughly as a distinct
          knowledge of it. If we have once for all distinctly recognised not
          only our good qualities and our strength, but also our defects and
          weakness, established our aim accordingly, and rest satisfied
          concerning what cannot be attained, we thus escape in the surest
          way, as far as our individuality permits, the bitterest of all
          sorrows, discontentment with ourselves, which is the inevitable
          result of ignorance of our own individuality, of false conceit and
          the audacity that proceeds from it. To the bitter chapter of the
          self-knowledge here recommended the lines of Ovid admit of
          excellent application—



“Optimus
                ille animi vindex lædentia pectus,


Vincula qui rupit,
                dedoluitque semel.”


[pg 397]
So much with
          regard to the acquired character, which, indeed,
          is not of so much importance for ethics proper as for life in the
          world. But its investigation was related as that of a third species
          to the investigation of the intelligible and the empirical
          character, in regard to which we were obliged to enter upon a
          somewhat detailed inquiry in order to bring out clearly how in all
          its phenomena the will is subject to necessity, while yet in itself
          it may be called free and even omnipotent.
§ 56. This
          freedom, this omnipotence, as the expression of which the whole
          visible world exists and progressively develops in accordance with
          the laws which belong to the form of knowledge, can now, at the
          point at which in its most perfect manifestation it has attained to
          the completely adequate knowledge of its own nature, express itself
          anew in two ways. Either it wills here, at the summit of mental
          endowment and self-consciousness, simply what it willed before
          blindly and unconsciously, and if so, knowledge always remains its
          motive in the whole as in the
          particular case. Or, conversely, this knowledge becomes for it a
          quieter, which appeases and
          suppresses all willing. This is that assertion and denial of the
          will to live which was stated above in general terms. As, in the
          reference of individual conduct, a general, not a particular
          manifestation of will, it does not disturb and modify the
          development of the character, nor does it find its expression in
          particular actions; but, either by an ever more marked appearance
          of the whole method of action it has followed hitherto, or
          conversely by the entire suppression of it, it expresses in a
          living form the maxims which the will has freely adopted in
          accordance with the knowledge it has now attained to. By the
          explanations we have just given of freedom, necessity, and
          character, we have somewhat facilitated and prepared the way for
          the clearer development of all this, which is the principal subject
          of this last book. But we shall have done so still more when we
          have turned our attention to [pg 398] life itself, the willing or not willing of
          which is the great question, and have endeavoured to find out
          generally what the will itself, which is everywhere the inmost
          nature of this life, will really attain by its assertion—in what
          way and to what extent this assertion satisfies or can satisfy the
          will; in short, what is generally and mainly to be regarded as its
          position in this its own world, which in every relation belongs to
          it.
First of all, I
          wish the reader to recall the passage with which we closed the
          Second Book,—a passage occasioned by the question, which met us
          then, as to the end and aim of the will. Instead of the answer to
          this question, it appeared clearly before us how, in all the grades
          of its manifestation, from the lowest to the highest, the will
          dispenses altogether with a final goal and aim. It always strives,
          for striving is its sole nature, which no attained goal can put an
          end to. Therefore it is not susceptible of any final satisfaction,
          but can only be restrained by hindrances, while in itself it goes
          on for ever. We see this in the simplest of all natural phenomena,
          gravity, which does not cease to strive and press towards a
          mathematical centre to reach which would be the annihilation both
          of itself and matter, and would not cease even if the whole
          universe were already rolled into one ball. We see it in the other
          simple natural phenomena. A solid tends towards fluidity either by
          melting or dissolving, for only so will its chemical forces be
          free; rigidity is the imprisonment in which it is held by cold. The
          fluid tends towards the gaseous state, into which it passes at once
          as soon as all pressure is removed from it. No body is without
          relationship, i.e., without tendency or
          without desire and longing, as Jacob Böhme would say. Electricity
          transmits its inner self-repulsion to infinity, though the mass of
          the earth absorbs the effect. Galvanism is certainly, so long as
          the pile is working, an aimless, unceasingly repeated act of
          repulsion and attraction. The existence of the plant is just such a
          restless, [pg
          399]
          never satisfied striving, a ceaseless tendency through
          ever-ascending forms, till the end, the seed, becomes a new
          starting-point; and this repeated ad
          infinitum—nowhere an end, nowhere a final
          satisfaction, nowhere a resting-place. It will also be remembered,
          from the Second Book, that the multitude of natural forces and
          organised forms everywhere strive with each other for the matter in
          which they desire to appear, for each of them only possesses what
          it has wrested from the others; and thus a constant internecine war
          is waged, from which, for the most part, arises the resistance
          through which that striving, which constitutes the inner nature of
          everything, is at all points hindered; struggles in vain, yet, from
          its nature, cannot leave off; toils on laboriously till this
          phenomenon dies, when others eagerly seize its place and its
          matter.
We have long
          since recognised this striving, which constitutes the kernel and
          in-itself of everything, as identical with that which in us, where
          it manifests itself most distinctly in the light of the fullest
          consciousness, is called will. Its hindrance through an
          obstacle which places itself between it and its temporary aim we
          call suffering, and, on the other hand,
          its attainment of the end satisfaction, wellbeing, happiness. We
          may also transfer this terminology to the phenomena of the
          unconscious world, for though weaker in degree, they are identical
          in nature. Then we see them involved in constant suffering, and
          without any continuing happiness. For all effort springs from
          defect—from discontent with one's estate—is thus suffering so long
          as it is not satisfied; but no satisfaction is lasting, rather it
          is always merely the starting-point of a new effort. The striving
          we see everywhere hindered in many ways, everywhere in conflict,
          and therefore always under the form of suffering. Thus, if there is
          no final end of striving, there is no measure and end of
          suffering.
But what we only
          discover in unconscious Nature by sharpened observation, and with
          an effort, presents itself [pg 400] distinctly to us in the intelligent world in
          the life of animals, whose constant suffering is easily proved. But
          without lingering over these intermediate grades, we shall turn to
          the life of man, in which all this appears with the greatest
          distinctness, illuminated by the clearest knowledge; for as the
          phenomenon of will becomes more complete, the suffering also
          becomes more and more apparent. In the plant there is as yet no
          sensibility, and therefore no pain. A certain very small degree of
          suffering is experienced by the lowest species of animal
          life—infusoria and radiata; even in insects the capacity to feel
          and suffer is still limited. It first appears in a high degree with
          the complete nervous system of vertebrate animals, and always in a
          higher degree the more intelligence develops. Thus, in proportion
          as knowledge attains to distinctness, as consciousness ascends,
          pain also increases, and therefore reaches its highest degree in
          man. And then, again, the more distinctly a man knows, the more
          intelligent he is, the more pain he has; the man who is gifted with
          genius suffers most of all. In this sense, that is, with reference
          to the degree of knowledge in general, not mere abstract rational
          knowledge, I understand and use here that saying of the Preacher:
          Qui auget scientiam, auget at
          dolorem. That philosophical painter or painting
          philosopher, Tischbein, has very beautifully expressed the accurate
          relation between the degree of consciousness and that of suffering
          by exhibiting it in a visible and clear form in a drawing. The
          upper half of his drawing represents women whose children have been
          stolen, and who in different groups and attitudes, express in many
          ways deep maternal pain, anguish, and despair. The lower half of
          the drawing represents sheep whose lambs have been taken away. They
          are arranged and grouped in precisely the same way; so that every
          human head, every human attitude of the upper half, has below a
          brute head and attitude corresponding to it. Thus we see distinctly
          how the pain which is possible in the dull brute consciousness
          [pg 401] is related to the
          violent grief, which only becomes possible through distinctness of
          knowledge and clearness of consciousness.
We desire to
          consider in this way, in human existence, the inner and
          essential destiny of will. Every one will easily recognise that
          same destiny expressed in various degrees in the life of the
          brutes, only more weakly, and may also convince himself to his own
          satisfaction, from the suffering animal world, how essential to
          all life is suffering.
§ 57. At every
          grade that is enlightened by knowledge, the will appears as an
          individual. The human individual finds himself as finite in
          infinite space and time, and consequently as a vanishing quantity
          compared with them. He is projected into them, and, on account of
          their unlimited nature, he has always a merely relative, never
          absolute when and where
          of his existence; for his place and duration are finite parts of
          what is infinite and boundless. His real existence is only in the
          present, whose unchecked flight into the past is a constant
          transition into death, a constant dying. For his past life, apart
          from its possible consequences for the present, and the testimony
          regarding the will that is expressed in it, is now entirely done
          with, dead, and no longer anything; and, therefore, it must be, as
          a matter of reason, indifferent to him whether the content of that
          past was pain or pleasure. But the present is always passing
          through his hands into the past; the future is quite uncertain and
          always short. Thus his existence, even when we consider only its
          formal side, is a constant hurrying of the present into the dead
          past, a constant dying. But if we look at it from the physical
          side; it is clear that, as our walking is admittedly merely a
          constantly prevented falling, the life of our body is only a
          constantly prevented dying, an ever-postponed death: finally, in
          the same way, the activity of our mind is a constantly deferred
          ennui. [pg
          402]
          Every breath we draw wards off the death that is constantly
          intruding upon us. In this way we fight with it every moment, and
          again, at longer intervals, through every meal we eat, every sleep
          we take, every time we warm ourselves, &c. In the end, death
          must conquer, for we became subject to him through birth, and he
          only plays for a little while with his prey before he swallows it
          up. We pursue our life, however, with great interest and much
          solicitude as long as possible, as we blow out a soap-bubble as
          long and as large as possible, although we know perfectly well that
          it will burst.
We saw that the
          inner being of unconscious nature is a constant striving without
          end and without rest. And this appears to us much more distinctly
          when we consider the nature of brutes and man. Willing and striving
          is its whole being, which may be very well compared to an
          unquenchable thirst. But the basis of all willing is need,
          deficiency, and thus pain. Consequently, the nature of brutes and
          man is subject to pain originally and through its very being. If,
          on the other hand, it lacks objects of desire, because it is at
          once deprived of them by a too easy satisfaction, a terrible void
          and ennui comes over it, i.e., its being and existence
          itself becomes an unbearable burden to it. Thus its life swings
          like a pendulum backwards and forwards between pain and ennui. This
          has also had to express itself very oddly in this way; after man
          had transferred all pain and torments to hell, there then remained
          nothing over for heaven but ennui.
But the constant
          striving which constitutes the inner nature of every manifestation
          of will obtains its primary and most general foundation at the
          higher grades of objectification, from the fact that here the will
          manifests itself as a living body, with the iron command to nourish
          it; and what gives strength to this command is just that this body
          is nothing but the objectified will to live [pg 403] itself. Man, as the most complete
          objectification of that will, is in like measure also the most
          necessitous of all beings: he is through and through concrete
          willing and needing; he is a concretion of a thousand necessities.
          With these he stands upon the earth, left to himself, uncertain
          about everything except his own need and misery. Consequently the
          care for the maintenance of that existence under exacting demands,
          which are renewed every day, occupies, as a rule, the whole of
          human life. To this is directly related the second claim, that of
          the propagation of the species. At the same time he is threatened
          from all sides by the most different kinds of dangers, from which
          it requires constant watchfulness to escape. With cautious steps
          and casting anxious glances round him he pursues his path, for a
          thousand accidents and a thousand enemies lie in wait for him. Thus
          he went while yet a savage, thus he goes in civilised life; there
          is no security for him.



“Qualibus in tenebris
                vitæ, quantisque periclis


Degitur hocc' ævi,
                quodcunque est!”—Lucr.
ii. 15.



The life of the
          great majority is only a constant struggle for this existence
          itself, with the certainty of losing it at last. But what enables
          them to endure this wearisome battle is not so much the love of
          life as the fear of death, which yet stands in the background as
          inevitable, and may come upon them at any moment. Life itself is a
          sea, full of rocks and whirlpools, which man avoids with the
          greatest care and solicitude, although he knows that even if he
          succeeds in getting through with all his efforts and skill, he yet
          by doing so comes nearer at every step to the greatest, the total,
          inevitable, and irremediable shipwreck, death; nay, even steers
          right upon it: this is the final goal of the laborious voyage, and
          worse for him than all the rocks from which he has escaped.
Now it is well
          worth observing that, on the one hand, [pg 404] the suffering and misery of life may easily
          increase to such an extent that death itself, in the flight from
          which the whole of life consists, becomes desirable, and we hasten
          towards it voluntarily; and again, on the other hand, that as soon
          as want and suffering permit rest to a man, ennui is at once so
          near that he necessarily requires diversion. The striving after
          existence is what occupies all living things and maintains them in
          motion. But when existence is assured, then they know not what to
          do with it; thus the second thing that sets them in motion is the
          effort to get free from the burden of existence, to make it cease
          to be felt, “to kill time,”
i.e., to escape from ennui.
          Accordingly we see that almost all men who are secure from want and
          care, now that at last they have thrown off all other burdens,
          become a burden to themselves, and regard as a gain every hour they
          succeed in getting through; and thus every diminution of the very
          life which, till then, they have employed all their powers to
          maintain as long as possible. Ennui is by no means an evil to be
          lightly esteemed; in the end it depicts on the countenance real
          despair. It makes beings who love each other so little as men do,
          seek each other eagerly, and thus becomes the source of social
          intercourse. Moreover, even from motives of policy, public
          precautions are everywhere taken against it, as against other
          universal calamities. For this evil may drive men to the greatest
          excesses, just as much as its opposite extreme, famine: the people
          require panem et
          circenses. The strict penitentiary system of
          Philadelphia makes use of ennui alone as a means of punishment,
          through solitary confinement and idleness, and it is found so
          terrible that it has even led prisoners to commit suicide. As want
          is the constant scourge of the people, so ennui is that of the
          fashionable world. In middle-class life ennui is represented by the
          Sunday, and want by the six week-days.
Thus between
          desiring and attaining all human life flows on throughout. The wish
          is, in its nature, pain; [pg
          405]
          the attainment soon begets satiety: the end was only apparent;
          possession takes away the charm; the wish, the need, presents
          itself under a new form; when it does not, then follows
          desolateness, emptiness, ennui, against which the conflict is just
          as painful as against want. That wish and satisfaction should
          follow each other neither too quickly nor too slowly reduces the
          suffering, which both occasion to the smallest amount, and
          constitutes the happiest life. For that which we might otherwise
          call the most beautiful part of life, its purest joy, if it were
          only because it lifts us out of real existence and transforms us
          into disinterested spectators of it—that is, pure knowledge, which
          is foreign to all willing, the pleasure of the beautiful, the true
          delight in art—this is granted only to a very few, because it
          demands rare talents, and to these few only as a passing dream. And
          then, even these few, on account of their higher intellectual
          power, are made susceptible of far greater suffering than duller
          minds can ever feel, and are also placed in lonely isolation by a
          nature which is obviously different from that of others; thus here
          also accounts are squared. But to the great majority of men purely
          intellectual pleasures are not accessible. They are almost quite
          incapable of the joys which lie in pure knowledge. They are
          entirely given up to willing. If, therefore, anything is to win
          their sympathy, to be interesting to them, it must (as
          is implied in the meaning of the word) in some way excite their
          will, even if it is only through a
          distant and merely problematical relation to it; the will must not
          be left altogether out of the question, for their existence lies
          far more in willing than in knowing,—action and reaction is their
          one element. We may find in trifles and everyday occurrences the
          naïve expressions of this quality. Thus, for example, at any place
          worth seeing they may visit, they write their names, in order thus
          to react, to affect the place since it does not affect them. Again,
          when they see a strange rare animal, they cannot [pg 406] easily confine themselves to merely
          observing it; they must rouse it, tease it, play with it, merely to
          experience action and reaction; but this need for excitement of the
          will manifests itself very specially in the discovery and support
          of card-playing, which is quite peculiarly the expression of the
          miserable side of humanity.
But whatever
          nature and fortune may have done, whoever a man be and whatever he
          may possess, the pain which is essential to life cannot be thrown
          off:—Πηλειδης δ᾽ ῳμωξεν, ιδων εις ουρανον ευρυν (Pelides autem ejulavit, intuitus in cælum
          latum). And again:—Ζηνος μεν παις ηα Κρονιονος, αυταρ
          οιζυν ειχον απειρεσιην (Jovis quidem filius
          eram Saturnii; verum ærumnam habebam infinitam). The
          ceaseless efforts to banish suffering accomplish no more than to
          make it change its form. It is essentially deficiency, want, care
          for the maintenance of life. If we succeed, which is very
          difficult, in removing pain in this form, it immediately assumes a
          thousand others, varying according to age and circumstances, such
          as lust, passionate love, jealousy, envy, hatred, anxiety,
          ambition, covetousness, sickness, &c., &c. If at last it
          can find entrance in no other form, it comes in the sad, grey
          garments of tediousness and ennui, against which we then strive in
          various ways. If finally we succeed in driving this away, we shall
          hardly do so without letting pain enter in one of its earlier
          forms, and the dance begin again from the beginning; for all human
          life is tossed backwards and forwards between pain and ennui.
          Depressing as this view of life is, I will draw attention, by the
          way, to an aspect of it from which consolation may be drawn, and
          perhaps even a stoical indifference to one's own present ills may
          be attained. For our impatience at these arises for the most part
          from the fact that we regard them as brought about by a chain of
          causes which might easily be different. We do not generally grieve
          over ills which are directly necessary and quite universal; for
          example, the necessity of age and of [pg 407] death, and many daily inconveniences. It is
          rather the consideration of the accidental nature of the
          circumstances that brought some sorrow just to us, that gives it
          its sting. But if we have recognised that pain, as such, is
          inevitable and essential to life, and that nothing depends upon
          chance but its mere fashion, the form under which it presents
          itself, that thus our present sorrow fills a place that, without
          it, would at once be occupied by another which now is excluded by
          it, and that therefore fate can affect us little in what is
          essential; such a reflection, if it were to become a living
          conviction, might produce a considerable degree of stoical
          equanimity, and very much lessen the anxious care for our own
          well-being. But, in fact, such a powerful control of reason over
          directly felt suffering seldom or never occurs.
Besides, through
          this view of the inevitableness of pain, of the supplanting of one
          pain by another, and the introduction of a new pain through the
          passing away of that which preceded it, one might be led to the
          paradoxical but not absurd hypothesis, that in every individual the
          measure of the pain essential to him was determined once for all by
          his nature, a measure which could neither remain empty, nor be more
          than filled, however much the form of the suffering might change.
          Thus his suffering and well-being would by no means be determined
          from without, but only through that measure, that natural
          disposition, which indeed might experience certain additions and
          diminutions from the physical condition at different times, but
          yet, on the whole, would remain the same, and would just be what is
          called the temperament, or, more accurately, the degree in which he
          might be ευκολος or δυσκολος, as Plato expresses it in the First
          Book of the Republic, i.e., in an easy or difficult
          mood. This hypothesis is supported not only by the well-known
          experience that great suffering makes all lesser ills cease to be
          felt, and conversely that freedom from great suffering makes even
          the most trifling inconveniences torment us [pg 408] and put us out of humour; but
          experience also teaches that if a great misfortune, at the mere
          thought of which we shuddered, actually befalls us, as soon as we
          have overcome the first pain of it, our disposition remains for the
          most part unchanged; and, conversely, that after the attainment of
          some happiness we have long desired, we do not feel ourselves on
          the whole and permanently very much better off and agreeably
          situated than before. Only the moment at which these changes occur
          affects us with unusual strength, as deep sorrow or exulting joy,
          but both soon pass away, for they are based upon illusion. For they
          do not spring from the immediately present pleasure or pain, but
          only from the opening up of a new future which is anticipated in
          them. Only by borrowing from the future could pain or pleasure be
          heightened so abnormally, and consequently not enduringly. It would
          follow, from the hypothesis advanced, that a large part of the
          feeling of suffering and of well-being would be subjective and
          determined a priori, as is
          the case with knowing; and we may add the following remarks as
          evidence in favour of it. Human cheerfulness or dejection are
          manifestly not determined by external circumstances, such as wealth
          and position, for we see at least as many glad faces among the poor
          as among the rich. Further, the motives which induce suicide are so
          very different, that we can assign no motive that is so great as to
          bring it about, even with great probability, in every character,
          and few that would be so small that the like of them had never
          caused it. Now although the degree of our serenity or sadness is
          not at all times the same, yet, in consequence of this view, we
          shall not attribute it to the change of outward circumstances, but
          to that of the inner condition, the physical state. For when an
          actual, though only temporary, increase of our serenity, even to
          the extent of joyfulness, takes place, it usually appears without
          any external occasion. It is true that [pg 409] we often see our pain arise only from some
          definite external relation, and are visibly oppressed and saddened
          by this only. Then we believe that if only this were taken away,
          the greatest contentment would necessarily ensue. But this is
          illusion. The measure of our pain and our happiness is on the
          whole, according to our hypothesis, subjectively determined for
          each point of time, and the motive for sadness is related to that,
          just as a blister which draws to a head all the bad humours
          otherwise distributed is related to the body. The pain which is at
          that period of time essential to our nature, and therefore cannot
          be shaken off, would, without the definite external cause of our
          suffering, be divided at a hundred points, and appear in the form
          of a hundred little annoyances and cares about things which we now
          entirely overlook, because our capacity for pain is already filled
          by that chief evil which has concentrated in a point all the
          suffering otherwise dispersed. This corresponds also to the
          observation that if a great and pressing care is lifted from our
          breast by its fortunate issue, another immediately takes its place,
          the whole material of which was already there before, yet could not
          come into consciousness as care because there was no capacity left
          for it, and therefore this material of care remained indistinct and
          unobserved in a cloudy form on the farthest horizon of
          consciousness. But now that there is room, this prepared material
          at once comes forward and occupies the throne of the reigning care
          of the day (πρυτανευουσα). And if it is very much lighter in its
          matter than the material of the care which has vanished, it knows
          how to blow itself out so as apparently to equal it in size, and
          thus, as the chief care of the day, completely fills the
          throne.
Excessive joy
          and very keen suffering always occur in the same person, for they
          condition each other reciprocally, and are also in common
          conditioned by great activity of the mind. Both are produced, as we
          have just seen, not by what is really present, but by the
          anticipation of [pg
          410]
          the future. But since pain is essential to life, and its degree is
          also determined by the nature of the subject, sudden changes,
          because they are always external, cannot really alter its degree.
          Thus an error and delusion always lies at the foundation of
          immoderate joy or grief, and consequently both these excessive
          strainings of the mind can be avoided by knowledge. Every
          immoderate joy (exultatio, insolens
          lætitia) always rests on the delusion that one has
          found in life what can never be found there—lasting satisfaction of
          the harassing desires and cares, which are constantly breeding new
          ones. From every particular delusion of this kind one must
          inevitably be brought back later, and then when it vanishes must
          pay for it with pain as bitter as the joy its entrance caused was
          keen. So far, then, it is precisely like a height from which one
          can come down only by a fall. Therefore one ought to avoid them;
          and every sudden excessive grief is just a fall from some such
          height, the vanishing of such a delusion, and so conditioned by it.
          Consequently we might avoid them both if we had sufficient control
          over ourselves to survey things always with perfect clearness as a
          whole and in their connection, and steadfastly to guard against
          really lending them the colours which we wish they had. The
          principal effort of the Stoical ethics was to free the mind from
          all such delusion and its consequences, and to give it instead an
          equanimity that could not be disturbed. It is this insight that
          inspires Horace in the well-known ode—
