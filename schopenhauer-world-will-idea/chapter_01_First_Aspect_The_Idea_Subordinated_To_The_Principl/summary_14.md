- Schopenhauer attacks Euclid’s logical-deductive method for geometry as substituting the “ground of knowing” (proof by contradiction, syllogism) for the proper “ground of being” (the immediate, a priori spatial relations grasped in pure intuition). This yields results without insight—like seeing a machine’s effects but not its mechanism.
- Euclid should have shown the reciprocal determination of a triangle’s sides and angles directly from space’s PSR-form (reason–consequent in spatial being), but instead offers disconnected propositions with artifices (reductio, auxiliary lines) that compel assent without explaining why.
- The method’s historical root: ancient skepticism about sense-perception (Eleatics, Megarics, Sophists, New Academy, Sceptics) led to privileging reason. Yet syllogisms also mislead. Because pure a priori intuition wasn’t distinguished from empirical perception, Euclid based axioms on intuition but the rest on reasoning.
- Proclus glimpsed the distinction (noted by Kepler), but only Kant decisively clarified that space/time are a priori intuitions, immune to sense illusion. Therefore geometry should trust its own intuitive evidence; its certainty equals logic’s, and within it, knowing that something is coincides with knowing why.
- By contrast, Euclid leaves us with “occult qualities” (e.g., equal rectangles from intersecting chords; the Pythagorean theorem): demonstrations show that but not why, whereas a simple, directly intuited figure reveals the necessary dependence (e.g., on the right angle).
