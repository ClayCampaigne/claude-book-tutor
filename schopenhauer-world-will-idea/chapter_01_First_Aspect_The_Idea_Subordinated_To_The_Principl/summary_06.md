- Natural science’s program: reduce all material states to one, spanning from the crudest matter to the human organism. Its two “extremes” remain unreached: chemistry seeks a primary element; physiology seeks the fully immediate object (the organism).
- Chemical antinomy: The law of homogeneity pushes toward one primordial chemical state, yet if only one state exists no chemical change could occur without a second to act on it (analogous to Epicurus’s problem of the first atomic deviation). Thus an unavoidable contradiction appears at the “lower” extreme.
- Irreducibility upward: What is chemical cannot be reduced to the mechanical, nor the organic to the chemical/electrical; reductionist revivals will fail.
- Materialism’s impossibility: As philosophy, natural science becomes materialism, which ignores the subject and the forms of knowing. “No object without a subject” renders talk of suns and planets without a knower meaningless qua idea.
- Second antinomy (subject–object): Causality suggests a long prehistory culminating in the first eye; yet the world, as idea, depends on that first eye. Resolution: time, space, and causality are only forms of phenomena. The world as idea appears with knowledge; outside knowledge there is no “before.” Time has no beginning; all beginning is in time. The “first present” is cognized as effect of an infinite past that is itself conditioned by this present within consciousness.
- UpShot: Seek the thing-in-itself outside both subject and object (to be treated as will in Book II).
- Critique of Fichte: He inverts dogmatism by deriving object from subject under an absolutized PSR, misreading Kant and preserving the false reason–consequent relation between subject and object (likely via the spatial form).
