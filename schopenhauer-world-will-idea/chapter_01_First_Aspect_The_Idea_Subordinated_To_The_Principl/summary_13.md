- Faculty of judgment mediates understanding and reason by carrying what is known in perception into clear concepts: it groups commonalities under one concept while distinguishing differences under others, according to purpose. Deficiency = silliness: failing to see identity-in-difference or difference-in-identity. Kant’s reflecting (from objects to concepts) vs subsuming (from concepts to objects) judgments fit this role.
- Truth cannot be produced by syllogisms alone; all demonstration is ultimately rooted in perception (either empirical or a priori intuition of space/time/causality). Abstract chains merely articulate what is already contained in premises; direct evidence is primary.
- Astronomy’s certainty stems from a priori spatial intuition (ground of being among space-relations), plus a simple natural force (gravity ∝ masses and inverse-square distance), the a priori law of inertia (from causality), and initial motions. Kepler’s laws and gravitation arose by judgment-led hypothesis and induction; syllogisms serve as bridges, not sources. With direct access (e.g., “telescopic eyes”), single perceptions could decide.
- A priori “metaphysical” truths are immediately known apodictically (e.g., permanence of matter, grounded in space, not time); proofs, if offered, show containment in indubitable truths. Demonstrations mainly silence disputants.
- Science’s hierarchical form eases organization but adds no certainty; conceptual vagueness/overlap makes syllogistic matter unreliable and prone to sophistry—hence immediate evidence is preferable when available.
- Critique of Euclid: mathematics perversely discards its native perceptual evidence for logical demonstrations. True insight requires the ground of being (intuitive space-relations per PSR), e.g., reciprocal determination of triangle sides/angles, rather than isolated, laborious propositions proved by contradiction, which reveal results but not inner necessity.
