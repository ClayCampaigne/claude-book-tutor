- Schopenhauer illustrates sophistry via overlapping concept-spheres: starting from a central concept (e.g., “travelling”), one can move outward along partial overlaps to various adjacent concepts, always proceeding center-to-circumference (never reversing), to reach any desired conclusion—whether framed as a speech or a syllogism. He suggests many “proved” scientific-philosophical systems later overturned (e.g., Leibniz-Wolff metaphysics, Ptolemaic astronomy, Stahl’s chemistry, Newton’s color theory) relied on such shifts.

- Certainty and rational knowledge (Wissen):
  - Reason is “receptive”; its only absolutely pure truths are the four metalogical principles: identity, contradiction, excluded middle, and sufficient reason of knowing.
  - Logic, though largely pure, presupposes the existence (not content) of concepts, which themselves presuppose perceptual ideas.
  - Mathematics draws content from a priori intuitions (space/time); pure natural science from the a priori law of causality in relation to space/time; all else from experience.
  - Rational knowledge = abstract, reproducible judgments grounded outside themselves in truth; animals lack Wissen though they have perception, memory, imagination. Rational knowledge is abstract consciousness—conceptual retention of what was otherwise known.

- “Feeling” is defined negatively as any conscious content that is not an abstract concept; hence it spans bodily sensations, emotions, moral/aesthetic/religious feelings, and even pre-conceptual a priori apprehensions (“feeling” geometrical truth). Confusions arise from reifying a special faculty of feeling; reserve “sensation” for bodily feeling.

- Reason transforms intuitive knowledge into abstract form for storage, communication, and planned action. Understanding knows causal-perceptual structures (levers, curves) immediately but only for the present particular; reason supplies principles enabling construction and application. Crucially, spatial relations cannot be directly rendered in abstract concepts—only numbers (temporal quantities) map cleanly to abstraction. Thus arithmetic is the universal science of quantity; geometry must be translated into arithmetic for precise, communicable, practical use. This forced translation of 3D space into 1D time (number) explains mathematical difficulty: space is suited to perception, time to abstraction.
