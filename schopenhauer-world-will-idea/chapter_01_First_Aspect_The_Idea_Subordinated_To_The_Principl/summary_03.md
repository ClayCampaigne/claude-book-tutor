- Clarifies scope of causality and PSR: Causality is a priori and built into perception itself (refuting Hume), but it holds only among objects. The subject–object correlation is presupposed by all knowledge and lies outside the PSR; thus no cause–effect relation exists between subject and object.

- Critique of the “outer world” controversy: Both realism (object causes idea) and Fichtean idealism (subject causes object) illegitimately extend PSR to the subject. Object and idea are identical as representation; positing an object-in-itself as cause of the idea is incoherent because object presupposes subject. The object’s true being, as object, is its efficacy (action); knowing its effects exhausts it qua idea.

- Empirical reality vs transcendental ideality: The spatiotemporal world is fully real as representation bound by causality (empirical reality), yet its entire active order exists only for the understanding and is dependent on the subject (transcendental ideality).

- Confusion of PSR’s forms: Error arises when the “ground of knowing” (valid for judgments/concepts) is demanded of perceptual objects, which have only a “ground of being” (causality). Truth/error pertain to abstract thought, not perception.

- Dream vs reality: Both dreams and life show internal PSR-connections; only awakening securely marks their disconnection. Sometimes the distinction is undecidable, justifying the ancient metaphor that life is a long dream.

- Kernel for Book II: The persistent question’s valid core is whether the world, besides being my idea, is akin to my body—known doubly as idea and as will. Book II answers yes; for now (Book I), even the body is treated solely as idea.
