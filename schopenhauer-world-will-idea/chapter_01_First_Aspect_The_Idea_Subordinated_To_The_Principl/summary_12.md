- Extends laughter theory: wit typically appears in words; folly in actions (or in stated intentions/judgments). Pedantry is folly born of distrust in one’s intuitive understanding and rigid reliance on abstract rules/maxims, yielding mismatch between concept and concrete cases. This produces stiffness in art and misfires in ethics; Schopenhauer faults Kant’s demand that moral worth stem solely from pure maxims as fostering “moral pedantry.” Abstraction omits fine predicates crucial in practice; “doctrinaires” know in abstract, not in concrete.
- Spurious wit: puns/calembours/equivocations. In wit, identity is in the concept and difference in reality; in puns, identity is in the word (terminology), difference in concepts. Misunderstanding is an unintentional pun, akin to folly versus wit.
- Turns to science (reason’s third benefit): Science is complete abstract knowledge of a class demarcated by a concept. It advances systematically from general to particular by ordering nested concept-spheres; mastery requires grasp of first principles. Sciences vary in subordination vs coordination: classifying sciences (zoology, botany, physics, chemistry) show strong subordination; history lacks deducibility and is not science strictly. Mathematics, though each proposition is intuitively evident, remains a science due to universality and graded derivations.
- Science’s aim is systematic completeness/facilitation, not superior certainty. Demonstrations presuppose undemonstrated truths; perception (a priori in math, a posteriori elsewhere) is the source of all truth (logic excepted).
- The faculty of judgment mediates understanding and reason by forming primary judgments from perception; exceptional judgment advances science; deficiency is silliness. Kant’s reflecting/subsuming judgment fits the two directions. Syllogisms alone cannot yield truth; their necessity is merely relative.
