- Critique of Fichte’s subject-first system: He absolutizes the principle of sufficient reason (PSR) as an eternal truth, making the ego the ground and the non-ego its consequent. Schopenhauer argues Fichte tacitly employs the PSR of existence in space to “spin” the object from the subject, and, like materialism, assumes the correlative (object) he purports to deduce. All deduction presupposes necessity, which itself rests on PSR; but PSR is only the universal form of the object and has no validity “before” or “outside” it. Thus both object-first and subject-first systems are circular.

- Schopenhauer’s method: Start from the idea (representation), whose primary form is the subject–object antithesis. The object’s form is PSR in distinct modes:
  - Time = PSR of existence as succession
  - Space = PSR of existence as position
  - Matter = causality
  - Concept = relation to a ground of knowing
  This pervasive relativity signals that the world’s inner nature lies outside representation (to be treated in Book II).

- Transition to human-exclusive cognition: Concepts (with reason as their subjective correlative) introduce reflection—an abstract, derivative consciousness not bound by the forms of perception and relating differently to PSR. Perception is immediate and certain; abstract thought brings doubt and potentially long-lived, harmful error, though truth, once clearly won, is irreversible.

- Distinctive powers of reason: It enables life beyond the present—planning, maxims, deliberate choice among abstractly compared motives, secrecy, and preparation for death. Language is its necessary organ, making possible cooperation, civilization, science, preservation and communication of concepts, and also the dissemination of error.

- Survey and critique: Philosophers agree reason is uniquely human but have failed to reduce its manifold expressions to one simple function. Locke and Leibniz rightly note general concepts as distinctive yet lose sight of this in their accounts; Kant (per Appendix) confuses the notion. Errors of great minds propagate widely. Closing claim: the understanding has only one function—immediate cognition of cause and effect.
