<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Book I advances the thesis “the world is my idea”: whatever exists for knowledge exists only as object relative to a subject. This subject–object antithesis is the primary form of representation, presupposed by and more fundamental than space, time, and causality. The subject is the unobjectifiable knower, outside space and time; the object exists only in relation to it and bears the forms that ground multiplicity. Remove the subject and the world as idea vanishes. Throughout Book I, will is bracketed; a thing-in-itself other than will and representation is dismissed as illusion.

The principle of sufficient reason (PSR) gives the universal form of objects in distinct modes: time as succession, space as reciprocal determination of position, matter as causality (actuality = efficacy), and, uniquely for concepts, the ground of knowing. Perception itself is intellectual: sensations are immediate bodily changes; the understanding, armed a priori with causality, posits their causes and thereby constructs the spatially extended world. Hence Hume is refuted, yet causality holds only among objects; the subject–object correlation lies outside the PSR.

This dissolves the “outer world” controversy. Realism (object causes idea) and Fichtean idealism (subject produces object) illicitly extend PSR beyond its domain. As representation the object’s whole being is its efficacy; its “cause” apart from the subject is meaningless. The world is empirically real—spatiotemporal and law-governed—yet transcendentally ideal, existing only for the understanding. Confusing PSR’s modes breeds error; truth and falsity pertain to abstract judgment, not perception, which yields reality or illusion.

A survey of the sciences ties each to a PSR form (geometry–space, arithmetic–time, natural science–causality, logic–ground of knowing). Natural science can relate states to states but, as materialism, becomes circular by presupposing the subject it ignores; reductionism meets antinomies (a single element would preclude chemical change, the organic resists derivation from the mechanical). Even the “first eye” paradox dissolves once time and causality are seen as forms of appearance: the world as idea arises with knowledge.

Transitioning to human-specific cognition, Schopenhauer distinguishes understanding from reason. Animals already have the former (a priori causality); only humans form concepts, the “ideas of ideas,” whose relations logic codifies as the PSR of knowing. All certainty ultimately rests on intuition—empirical or a priori (space, time, causality). Mathematics draws on pure intuition; Euclid’s deductive method obscures insight by substituting the ground of knowing for the ground of being. The chapter closes by pointing beyond representation to the world’s inner nature, to be disclosed in Book II as will.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Core thesis: “The world is my idea.” Everything that exists for knowledge exists only as object relative to a subject. This antithesis is more fundamental than space, time, or causality, which presuppose it.
- Scope of Book I: Consider the world solely as idea (representation), abstracting entirely from will. Later (Book II) the complementary truth appears: “the world is my will.” A putative “object in itself” distinct from idea and will is a philosophical illusion.
- Subject–object structure:
  - Subject: that which knows all things, never known; outside space and time; undivided and presupposed by all experience.
  - Object: exists only in relation to a subject; its forms are space and time, which ground multiplicity.
  - Any single percipient with its object constitutes the whole world as idea; remove the subject and the world as idea vanishes.
- Principle of sufficient reason (PSR): the general form of all objects; all a priori knowledge is the content of PSR and its consequences. Objects exist only in necessary relations (as determining/determined), hence relatively.
- Perception vs. abstract ideas: focus here on perceptual ideas (experience); abstract concepts (reason) will be treated later.
- Space and time are a priori intuitions (Kant), grounding mathematics. PSR appears in them as the “ground of being”: succession (time) and position/reciprocal determination (space).
- Time’s essence: evanescent succession; past/future empty, present a boundary. Analogous relativity extends to space and all causally/motivationally generated content (echoed by Heraclitus, Plato, Spinoza, Kant’s phenomenon/thing-in-itself, and Indian Mâyâ).
- Matter: nothing beyond causation; its being is its action. Only as active does it fill space and time; its action on the immediate object (itself matter) yields perception.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Time and space are nothing beyond PSR’s forms: time = pure succession; space = reciprocal determination of positions (geometry formalizes this).
- Matter is identical with causation: its being is action. Only as active does it fill space-time; effects are known only insofar as they alter the immediate object, yielding perception. Hence “actuality” (Wirklichkeit) = efficacy.
- Matter cannot be conceived apart from space and time; more, its essence is the union of both. Causality determines what occupies this place at this time; thus causality unites space with time. Without their union there’d be no matter: space-alone → rigid, changeless; time-alone → fleeting, without coexistence or permanence.
- Coexistence (and thus reality and permanence) arises only through matter: permanence is knowable only amid changing states of a persistent substance (matter).
- A priori traits of matter (from space-time forms): occupation/impenetrability (= causal action), extension, infinite divisibility, persistence/indestructibility, mobility. Weight is a posteriori (contra Kant).
- Faculties: pure sensibility correlates to empty space/time; understanding correlates to matter/causality. Perception is intellectual: immediate affection of the body (immediate object) is taken as effect, from which understanding posits causes (external objects). This presupposes causality a priori, refuting Hume.
- Crucial caveat: subject and object are not related as cause and effect; causality holds only among objects. Subject–object is the presupposed condition of all knowledge and of PSR itself.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- Clarifies scope of causality and PSR: Causality is a priori and built into perception itself (refuting Hume), but it holds only among objects. The subject–object correlation is presupposed by all knowledge and lies outside the PSR; thus no cause–effect relation exists between subject and object.

- Critique of the “outer world” controversy: Both realism (object causes idea) and Fichtean idealism (subject causes object) illegitimately extend PSR to the subject. Object and idea are identical as representation; positing an object-in-itself as cause of the idea is incoherent because object presupposes subject. The object’s true being, as object, is its efficacy (action); knowing its effects exhausts it qua idea.

- Empirical reality vs transcendental ideality: The spatiotemporal world is fully real as representation bound by causality (empirical reality), yet its entire active order exists only for the understanding and is dependent on the subject (transcendental ideality).

- Confusion of PSR’s forms: Error arises when the “ground of knowing” (valid for judgments/concepts) is demanded of perceptual objects, which have only a “ground of being” (causality). Truth/error pertain to abstract thought, not perception.

- Dream vs reality: Both dreams and life show internal PSR-connections; only awakening securely marks their disconnection. Sometimes the distinction is undecidable, justifying the ancient metaphor that life is a long dream.

- Kernel for Book II: The persistent question’s valid core is whether the world, besides being my idea, is akin to my body—known doubly as idea and as will. Book II answers yes; for now (Book I), even the body is treated solely as idea.
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- Reframes the “outer world” problem’s valid core: beyond being my idea, is the world akin to my own body—known doubly as idea and as will? Book II will affirm this; for now (Book I) everything, including the body, is treated solely as idea.
- Methodological bracketing: Though we immediately know the thing-in-itself in our body, this is set aside to analyze the body as immediate object for knowledge.
- Conditions of perception:
  - Objective: material things can act on each other (causal efficacy).
  - Subjective: the understanding supplies the law of causality (perception exists only through/for it), and animal sensibility makes certain bodies “immediate objects” via sensation.
- Role of sensation and understanding:
  - Simple sensation (immediate bodily changes) precedes understanding and supplies first data.
  - Object proper (spatially extended idea) arises only when understanding applies causality; even one’s own body’s form is known only mediately “in the brain” (e.g., via sight/touch; a blind person learns form gradually).
- Animal life vs plants:
  - Animals: knowledge-guided movement by motives; hence all animals have understanding (a priori grasp of cause–effect), differing only in degree.
  - Plants: movement by stimuli; unorganized matter moves only by causes narrowly so called.
- Understanding vs reason:
  - Understanding = immediate intuition of causal connections (the source of scientific discoveries, invention, prudence/sagacity in practice).
  - Reason = abstract concepts that fix, relate, and communicate what understanding intuits; no immediate knowledge.
- Cognitive deficits taxonomy: lack of understanding = stupidity; poor practical use of reason = foolishness; lack of judgment = silliness; impaired/absent memory = madness.
- Distinguish understanding from instinct (to be treated in Book II).
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Animal understanding is a priori grasp of causality, the condition of perception (e.g., a young dog anticipates falling). Distinguish it from instinct (to be treated later).
- Cognitive norms:
  - Truth = correct abstract judgment (reason); Error opposes truth.
  - Reality = correct causal inference in perception (understanding); Illusion opposes reality.
  - Illusions arise when identical effects could stem from two causes; understanding non-reflectively assumes the common cause, yielding a perceived but false object. Examples: double vision/feeling from atypical sense-organ positions, bent stick in water, mirror images, moon-horizon enlargement and mountain-distance misjudgments via misapplied atmospheric perspective. Reason can correct judgments but cannot dispel the illusory perception; understanding is non-rational and distinct from reason.
- Methodological stance: start from “idea” (presupposing subject–object); time, space, causality belong to the object yet are knowable a priori and fall under the PSR, which applies only within the object—not to the subject–object relation.
- Critique of “identity philosophy” (Schelling): it conflates two opposite errors—Fichtean idealism (object from subject under PSR) and “philosophy of nature” (subject from object via constructive PSR).
- Taxonomy of object-starting systems: materialists (real world), Spinoza/Eleatics (abstract concept), Pythagoreans/I Ching (time/number), scholastics (will/creation).
- Refutation of materialism: it presupposes the knowing subject it tries to derive (circularity); all objectivity is mediated by the brain’s forms (space, time, causality). Science, guided by PSR, relates ideas to ideas and cannot reach the world’s inmost nature.
- Structure of sciences: each has an organon (a PSR form) and a problem (its object): geometry (space/ground of being in space), arithmetic (time), logic (ground of knowing), history (motives), natural science (matter/causality). Natural science aims to reduce all material states to one, spanning from dead matter to the human organism.
</CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>
- Natural science’s program: reduce all material states to one, spanning from the crudest matter to the human organism. Its two “extremes” remain unreached: chemistry seeks a primary element; physiology seeks the fully immediate object (the organism).
- Chemical antinomy: The law of homogeneity pushes toward one primordial chemical state, yet if only one state exists no chemical change could occur without a second to act on it (analogous to Epicurus’s problem of the first atomic deviation). Thus an unavoidable contradiction appears at the “lower” extreme.
- Irreducibility upward: What is chemical cannot be reduced to the mechanical, nor the organic to the chemical/electrical; reductionist revivals will fail.
- Materialism’s impossibility: As philosophy, natural science becomes materialism, which ignores the subject and the forms of knowing. “No object without a subject” renders talk of suns and planets without a knower meaningless qua idea.
- Second antinomy (subject–object): Causality suggests a long prehistory culminating in the first eye; yet the world, as idea, depends on that first eye. Resolution: time, space, and causality are only forms of phenomena. The world as idea appears with knowledge; outside knowledge there is no “before.” Time has no beginning; all beginning is in time. The “first present” is cognized as effect of an infinite past that is itself conditioned by this present within consciousness.
- UpShot: Seek the thing-in-itself outside both subject and object (to be treated as will in Book II).
- Critique of Fichte: He inverts dogmatism by deriving object from subject under an absolutized PSR, misreading Kant and preserving the false reason–consequent relation between subject and object (likely via the spatial form).
</CHUNK 6 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>
- Critique of Fichte’s subject-first system: He absolutizes the principle of sufficient reason (PSR) as an eternal truth, making the ego the ground and the non-ego its consequent. Schopenhauer argues Fichte tacitly employs the PSR of existence in space to “spin” the object from the subject, and, like materialism, assumes the correlative (object) he purports to deduce. All deduction presupposes necessity, which itself rests on PSR; but PSR is only the universal form of the object and has no validity “before” or “outside” it. Thus both object-first and subject-first systems are circular.

- Schopenhauer’s method: Start from the idea (representation), whose primary form is the subject–object antithesis. The object’s form is PSR in distinct modes:
  - Time = PSR of existence as succession
  - Space = PSR of existence as position
  - Matter = causality
  - Concept = relation to a ground of knowing
  This pervasive relativity signals that the world’s inner nature lies outside representation (to be treated in Book II).

- Transition to human-exclusive cognition: Concepts (with reason as their subjective correlative) introduce reflection—an abstract, derivative consciousness not bound by the forms of perception and relating differently to PSR. Perception is immediate and certain; abstract thought brings doubt and potentially long-lived, harmful error, though truth, once clearly won, is irreversible.

- Distinctive powers of reason: It enables life beyond the present—planning, maxims, deliberate choice among abstractly compared motives, secrecy, and preparation for death. Language is its necessary organ, making possible cooperation, civilization, science, preservation and communication of concepts, and also the dissemination of error.

- Survey and critique: Philosophers agree reason is uniquely human but have failed to reduce its manifold expressions to one simple function. Locke and Leibniz rightly note general concepts as distinctive yet lose sight of this in their accounts; Kant (per Appendix) confuses the notion. Errors of great minds propagate widely. Closing claim: the understanding has only one function—immediate cognition of cause and effect.
</CHUNK 7 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>
- Schopenhauer posits a single function for reason (parallel to understanding’s single function of immediate causal intuition): the formation and use of abstract concepts. “Rational/irrational” simply marks the application/non-application of this function.
- Concepts:
  - A distinct class of ideas unique to humans; abstract, discursive, not sensuously presentable or verifiable like perceptual ideas.
  - Their effects are empirical (language, planned action, science), but concepts themselves are only thinkable.
  - Language is reason speaking to reason via arbitrary signs; meaning is grasped without imagery. Animals, lacking reason (concepts), cannot truly learn language despite having sense organs and perceptions.
  - Concepts are “ideas of ideas”: reflection is a copy of perception in a different medium. They necessarily relate to perception.
- PSR’s form here is “ground of knowing”: each concept’s entire nature is its relation to another idea as its ground of knowledge; the regress must terminate in perception. Thus reflection rests on perception (unlike other PSR forms that stay within their class).
- Abstracta vs “concreta”: abstracta (e.g., relation, virtue) are mediated only by other concepts; “concreta” (e.g., man, stone) are immediately grounded in perception yet remain abstract.
- Generality is intrinsic to concepts; “containing much under it” is secondary. Even a concept with one real instance (e.g., a town known only via maps) has a sphere (extension).
- Logic as schematism of concept-relations: Euler-style circles model inclusion/overlap among concept spheres, grounding judgment (subject–predicate) and syllogistic forms; hypothetical judgments combine judgments, not concepts. Logic is theoretically illuminating but not practically necessary for sound thinking.
</CHUNK 8 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>
- Extends the “sphere” schematism of concepts to syllogistic chains: combining multiple inclusions yields long trains of syllogisms; all rules can be seen, deduced, and explained from these spatial relations.
- Logic’s status and utility:
  - Purely theoretical, not practically needed for correct thinking. Reason’s native procedure in each case is more immediate and reliable than applying abstract rules; in logic, unlike other sciences, rules must be justified by particular cases.
  - Using logic “practically” is as misguided as consulting mechanics to walk; even expert logicians don’t apply rules in thinking.
  - Nonetheless, logic deserves independent, scientific treatment as the abstract knowledge of reason’s organization and as a chapter in philosophy concerned with rational/abstract cognition.
  - Proper exposition: derive judgment/syllogism rules from concept-sphere combinations and analyze the principle of sufficient reason of knowing alongside the three other fundamental laws of thought (metalogical truths). Logic is essentially a paraphrase of PSR of knowing.
  - Only limited practical use: naming an opponent’s intentional fallacies in debate.
- Historical sketch: born from Greek dialectical practice (Eleatics, Megarics, Sophists), formalized by codifying shared inferential forms; Aristotle systematized and perfected it. Medievals prized it; Kant revived interest via its role in knowing reason’s nature. Rejects claim of an earlier complete Indian logic.
- On sophistry: its deeper mechanism is exploiting partial overlaps of concept spheres—treating a concept partly within two others as if wholly within whichever suits one’s aim, chaining such shifts (e.g., “passion” as greatest force vs irrational/weakness). Crude named fallacies are secondary. A schema (using “travelling”) illustrates guided transitions from center concept outward.
</CHUNK 9 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>
- Schopenhauer illustrates sophistry via overlapping concept-spheres: starting from a central concept (e.g., “travelling”), one can move outward along partial overlaps to various adjacent concepts, always proceeding center-to-circumference (never reversing), to reach any desired conclusion—whether framed as a speech or a syllogism. He suggests many “proved” scientific-philosophical systems later overturned (e.g., Leibniz-Wolff metaphysics, Ptolemaic astronomy, Stahl’s chemistry, Newton’s color theory) relied on such shifts.

- Certainty and rational knowledge (Wissen):
  - Reason is “receptive”; its only absolutely pure truths are the four metalogical principles: identity, contradiction, excluded middle, and sufficient reason of knowing.
  - Logic, though largely pure, presupposes the existence (not content) of concepts, which themselves presuppose perceptual ideas.
  - Mathematics draws content from a priori intuitions (space/time); pure natural science from the a priori law of causality in relation to space/time; all else from experience.
  - Rational knowledge = abstract, reproducible judgments grounded outside themselves in truth; animals lack Wissen though they have perception, memory, imagination. Rational knowledge is abstract consciousness—conceptual retention of what was otherwise known.

- “Feeling” is defined negatively as any conscious content that is not an abstract concept; hence it spans bodily sensations, emotions, moral/aesthetic/religious feelings, and even pre-conceptual a priori apprehensions (“feeling” geometrical truth). Confusions arise from reifying a special faculty of feeling; reserve “sensation” for bodily feeling.

- Reason transforms intuitive knowledge into abstract form for storage, communication, and planned action. Understanding knows causal-perceptual structures (levers, curves) immediately but only for the present particular; reason supplies principles enabling construction and application. Crucially, spatial relations cannot be directly rendered in abstract concepts—only numbers (temporal quantities) map cleanly to abstraction. Thus arithmetic is the universal science of quantity; geometry must be translated into arithmetic for precise, communicable, practical use. This forced translation of 3D space into 1D time (number) explains mathematical difficulty: space is suited to perception, time to abstraction.
</CHUNK 10 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>
- Mathematics and abstraction:
  - Spatial relations are grasped instantly in perception but resist direct abstraction; to make them precise, communicable, and practically applicable, they must be translated into time-as-number (arithmetic). Hence geometry’s applications rely on arithmetic, making mathematics difficult.
  - Space suits perception (rich, 3D, easily intuited); time suits abstraction (1D number) but offers little to perception. Without spatial aids, number perception caps around ten; beyond that we think numbers abstractly. Algebraic symbols attach to clear concepts.
  - Two cognitive styles: some want perceptual, Euclidean-style demonstrations; others prefer abstract formulas and long chains of reasoning. Abstract knowledge’s chief value is permanence and communicability.

- Practice vs reflection:
  - Immediate, perceptual understanding suffices for solo, continuous action (e.g., billiards, inventors building their own machines). Coordinated, time-separated, multi-person work requires abstract planning via reason.
  - Reflection can hinder skilled, time-critical performance (billiards, fighting, singing, tuning). Practical intuitions (razor angle, physiognomy/pathognomy) elude concepts; concepts are like mosaic tiles versus painting’s continuities, hence infertile for producing art (they aid only technique). In social behavior, concepts yield mere polish; charm must be unpremeditated. Dissimulation cannot be sustained.

- Ethics:
  - Virtue/holiness arise from the will’s depths, not from dogmatic reflection; dogmas occupy reason, but action follows character and “feelings.” Reason helps by preserving resolutions and supplying maxims, not as the source.

- Laughter (theory of the ludicrous):
  - Cause: sudden perception of incongruity between a concept and the real object(s) subsumed under it.
  - Two species:
    - Wit: intentionally uniting disparate objects under one concept (from objects to concept), revealed in words.
    - Folly: acting from a concept onto disparate realities as if they were the same, exposing disparity in action (or avowed intention).
  - Jester’s art: conceal wit as folly. Pedantry is folly born of distrust in understanding, rigidly following general rules, clinging to form over substance.
</CHUNK 11 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>
- Extends laughter theory: wit typically appears in words; folly in actions (or in stated intentions/judgments). Pedantry is folly born of distrust in one’s intuitive understanding and rigid reliance on abstract rules/maxims, yielding mismatch between concept and concrete cases. This produces stiffness in art and misfires in ethics; Schopenhauer faults Kant’s demand that moral worth stem solely from pure maxims as fostering “moral pedantry.” Abstraction omits fine predicates crucial in practice; “doctrinaires” know in abstract, not in concrete.
- Spurious wit: puns/calembours/equivocations. In wit, identity is in the concept and difference in reality; in puns, identity is in the word (terminology), difference in concepts. Misunderstanding is an unintentional pun, akin to folly versus wit.
- Turns to science (reason’s third benefit): Science is complete abstract knowledge of a class demarcated by a concept. It advances systematically from general to particular by ordering nested concept-spheres; mastery requires grasp of first principles. Sciences vary in subordination vs coordination: classifying sciences (zoology, botany, physics, chemistry) show strong subordination; history lacks deducibility and is not science strictly. Mathematics, though each proposition is intuitively evident, remains a science due to universality and graded derivations.
- Science’s aim is systematic completeness/facilitation, not superior certainty. Demonstrations presuppose undemonstrated truths; perception (a priori in math, a posteriori elsewhere) is the source of all truth (logic excepted).
- The faculty of judgment mediates understanding and reason by forming primary judgments from perception; exceptional judgment advances science; deficiency is silliness. Kant’s reflecting/subsuming judgment fits the two directions. Syllogisms alone cannot yield truth; their necessity is merely relative.
</CHUNK 12 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>
- Faculty of judgment mediates understanding and reason by carrying what is known in perception into clear concepts: it groups commonalities under one concept while distinguishing differences under others, according to purpose. Deficiency = silliness: failing to see identity-in-difference or difference-in-identity. Kant’s reflecting (from objects to concepts) vs subsuming (from concepts to objects) judgments fit this role.
- Truth cannot be produced by syllogisms alone; all demonstration is ultimately rooted in perception (either empirical or a priori intuition of space/time/causality). Abstract chains merely articulate what is already contained in premises; direct evidence is primary.
- Astronomy’s certainty stems from a priori spatial intuition (ground of being among space-relations), plus a simple natural force (gravity ∝ masses and inverse-square distance), the a priori law of inertia (from causality), and initial motions. Kepler’s laws and gravitation arose by judgment-led hypothesis and induction; syllogisms serve as bridges, not sources. With direct access (e.g., “telescopic eyes”), single perceptions could decide.
- A priori “metaphysical” truths are immediately known apodictically (e.g., permanence of matter, grounded in space, not time); proofs, if offered, show containment in indubitable truths. Demonstrations mainly silence disputants.
- Science’s hierarchical form eases organization but adds no certainty; conceptual vagueness/overlap makes syllogistic matter unreliable and prone to sophistry—hence immediate evidence is preferable when available.
- Critique of Euclid: mathematics perversely discards its native perceptual evidence for logical demonstrations. True insight requires the ground of being (intuitive space-relations per PSR), e.g., reciprocal determination of triangle sides/angles, rather than isolated, laborious propositions proved by contradiction, which reveal results but not inner necessity.
</CHUNK 13 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 14 SUMMARY>
- Schopenhauer attacks Euclid’s logical-deductive method for geometry as substituting the “ground of knowing” (proof by contradiction, syllogism) for the proper “ground of being” (the immediate, a priori spatial relations grasped in pure intuition). This yields results without insight—like seeing a machine’s effects but not its mechanism.
- Euclid should have shown the reciprocal determination of a triangle’s sides and angles directly from space’s PSR-form (reason–consequent in spatial being), but instead offers disconnected propositions with artifices (reductio, auxiliary lines) that compel assent without explaining why.
- The method’s historical root: ancient skepticism about sense-perception (Eleatics, Megarics, Sophists, New Academy, Sceptics) led to privileging reason. Yet syllogisms also mislead. Because pure a priori intuition wasn’t distinguished from empirical perception, Euclid based axioms on intuition but the rest on reasoning.
- Proclus glimpsed the distinction (noted by Kepler), but only Kant decisively clarified that space/time are a priori intuitions, immune to sense illusion. Therefore geometry should trust its own intuitive evidence; its certainty equals logic’s, and within it, knowing that something is coincides with knowing why.
- By contrast, Euclid leaves us with “occult qualities” (e.g., equal rectangles from intersecting chords; the Pythagorean theorem): demonstrations show that but not why, whereas a simple, directly intuited figure reveals the necessary dependence (e.g., on the right angle).
