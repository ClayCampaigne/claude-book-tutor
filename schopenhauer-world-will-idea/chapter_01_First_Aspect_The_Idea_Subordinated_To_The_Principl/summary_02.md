- Time and space are nothing beyond PSR’s forms: time = pure succession; space = reciprocal determination of positions (geometry formalizes this).
- Matter is identical with causation: its being is action. Only as active does it fill space-time; effects are known only insofar as they alter the immediate object, yielding perception. Hence “actuality” (Wirklichkeit) = efficacy.
- Matter cannot be conceived apart from space and time; more, its essence is the union of both. Causality determines what occupies this place at this time; thus causality unites space with time. Without their union there’d be no matter: space-alone → rigid, changeless; time-alone → fleeting, without coexistence or permanence.
- Coexistence (and thus reality and permanence) arises only through matter: permanence is knowable only amid changing states of a persistent substance (matter).
- A priori traits of matter (from space-time forms): occupation/impenetrability (= causal action), extension, infinite divisibility, persistence/indestructibility, mobility. Weight is a posteriori (contra Kant).
- Faculties: pure sensibility correlates to empty space/time; understanding correlates to matter/causality. Perception is intellectual: immediate affection of the body (immediate object) is taken as effect, from which understanding posits causes (external objects). This presupposes causality a priori, refuting Hume.
- Crucial caveat: subject and object are not related as cause and effect; causality holds only among objects. Subject–object is the presupposed condition of all knowledge and of PSR itself.
