- Mathematics and abstraction:
  - Spatial relations are grasped instantly in perception but resist direct abstraction; to make them precise, communicable, and practically applicable, they must be translated into time-as-number (arithmetic). Hence geometry’s applications rely on arithmetic, making mathematics difficult.
  - Space suits perception (rich, 3D, easily intuited); time suits abstraction (1D number) but offers little to perception. Without spatial aids, number perception caps around ten; beyond that we think numbers abstractly. Algebraic symbols attach to clear concepts.
  - Two cognitive styles: some want perceptual, Euclidean-style demonstrations; others prefer abstract formulas and long chains of reasoning. Abstract knowledge’s chief value is permanence and communicability.

- Practice vs reflection:
  - Immediate, perceptual understanding suffices for solo, continuous action (e.g., billiards, inventors building their own machines). Coordinated, time-separated, multi-person work requires abstract planning via reason.
  - Reflection can hinder skilled, time-critical performance (billiards, fighting, singing, tuning). Practical intuitions (razor angle, physiognomy/pathognomy) elude concepts; concepts are like mosaic tiles versus painting’s continuities, hence infertile for producing art (they aid only technique). In social behavior, concepts yield mere polish; charm must be unpremeditated. Dissimulation cannot be sustained.

- Ethics:
  - Virtue/holiness arise from the will’s depths, not from dogmatic reflection; dogmas occupy reason, but action follows character and “feelings.” Reason helps by preserving resolutions and supplying maxims, not as the source.

- Laughter (theory of the ludicrous):
  - Cause: sudden perception of incongruity between a concept and the real object(s) subsumed under it.
  - Two species:
    - Wit: intentionally uniting disparate objects under one concept (from objects to concept), revealed in words.
    - Folly: acting from a concept onto disparate realities as if they were the same, exposing disparity in action (or avowed intention).
  - Jester’s art: conceal wit as folly. Pedantry is folly born of distrust in understanding, rigidly following general rules, clinging to form over substance.
