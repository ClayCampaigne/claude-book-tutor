- Luxurious needs expand the simple city: new arts (painting, embroidery), precious materials (gold, ivory), entertainers (poets, rhapsodes, actors, dancers), varied manufactures (incl. women’s dress), many service roles (tutors, nurses, barbers, cooks, confectioners), swineherds, more animals, and more physicians.
- The original land becomes insufficient; exceeding necessity leads cities to seek neighbors’ land. Result: war becomes inevitable, arising from the same causes as most public and private evils—unlimited acquisition.
- Division of labor applies to war: soldiering is an art requiring lifelong training and practice, not a part-time task for farmers or craftsmen. Thus, the city needs a specialized guardian class selected for natural fitness.
- Guardian traits: bodily quickness, speed, and strength; spiritedness for courage; yet gentleness toward friends. Apparent paradox (spirit vs. gentleness) is resolved via the “well-bred dog” model—fierce to strangers, gentle to familiars, guided by knowledge of known vs. unknown—hence a love of learning. Conclusion: the best guardians must unite spirit with a philosophical disposition, plus speed and strength.
- Next step: their education. Begin with “music” (including literature) before gymnastic, since early formation is decisive. Institute strict censorship of stories: exclude poets’ “lies” about gods and heroes (Hesiod’s Uranus–Cronus–Zeus tales, divine quarrels, Homeric battles of gods), which model impiety and civil strife. Elders and poets must instead inculcate harmony and non-quarrel among citizens.
