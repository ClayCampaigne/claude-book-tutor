- Adeimantus amplifies Glaucon’s challenge: society praises justice mainly for its rewards and reputation, not for its own sake. Parents and teachers urge justice to secure offices, marriages, and honors.
- Poets and seers promise external payoffs: material prosperity for the “just” (Hesiod, Homer) and pleasant afterlife feasts (Musaeus), while the “wicked” face infamy and mythic punishments. Mystery rites and itinerant prophets sell expiations and curses, claiming gods can be swayed by sacrifices and charms.
- Prose writers echo that virtue is honorable but hard and less profitable; vice is easy and lucrative. People honor powerful wrongdoers and slight good but weak men; they also say gods often favor the wicked.
- Likely effect on clever youth: prioritize appearance over truth—seem just while practicing concealed injustice; use secret clubs, rhetoric, and force to avoid penalties. If gods don’t care or are bribable, injustice plus piety is optimal; if there’s Hades, mysteries can avert it.
- Conclusion: most are just only by compulsion; with power they turn unjust. The real failure is that no one shows justice/injustice as intrinsic states of soul—justice the greatest internal good, injustice the greatest evil.
- Adeimantus demands Socrates prove justice’s intrinsic benefit and injustice’s intrinsic harm to the possessor, stripping all reputational and external rewards/punishments. Socrates praises their formidable yet sincere challenge.
