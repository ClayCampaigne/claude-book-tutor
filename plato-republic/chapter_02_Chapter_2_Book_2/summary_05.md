- Extend poetic censorship to eliminate divine and heroic strife: no “wars in heaven,” Gigantomachy, or family quarrels among gods/heroes. Children should be told quarrelling is unholy and that citizens have never quarreled; poets must reinforce harmony.

- Founders set “forms” for poetry (they are not poets): early tales must be models of virtue because youths can’t discern allegory from literal stories.

- First theological principle: God is good and thus cause only of good.
  - Reasoning: the good is not hurtful; what is not hurtful does no evil; the good causes well-being; few human things are good, many are evil—so evils’ causes lie elsewhere, not in God.
  - Ban lines attributing mixed or evil fortunes to Zeus (e.g., “two jars”), divine instigation of oath-breaking/strife, or “God plants guilt to destroy a house.”
  - If punishments (Niobe, Pelops, Trojan tales) are told, they must present God as justly benefitting the wicked through punishment, not as author of their misery.

- Second theological principle: God is unchanging and never deceives.
  - Argument: the best things change least; a perfect being cannot change for the better and would not choose worse; thus no divine shape-shifting or disguised wanderings.
  - Distinguish “true lie” (ignorance in the soul about highest things), hated by gods and men, from verbal lies, which may be medicinal among humans; none apply to God, who cannot be ignorant, afraid, or deceiving.
  - Therefore, reject divine deceptions in poetry (e.g., Zeus’s lying dream to Agamemnon; Thetis’ claim that Apollo misled her). Poets teaching the young must present gods as simple, truthful, and constant, so guardians become true worshippers and like them.
