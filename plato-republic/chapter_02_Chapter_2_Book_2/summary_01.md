- After Book I’s inconclusive end, Glaucon renews the challenge: has Socrates truly shown justice is better than injustice? He distinguishes three classes of goods (valued: 1) for themselves, 2) for themselves and their results, 3) only for results). Socrates places justice in class 1/2 (valued in itself and for its results); “the many” treat it as class 3 (burdensome, pursued for rewards/reputation).
- Glaucon asks for a defense of justice “in itself” and proposes to restate the immoralist case in three steps: (1) justice’s origin as a social contract/compromise—laws arise because doing injustice is naturally good, suffering it is bad, and the bad outweighs the good, so people agree to neither; thus justice is the lesser evil, not a true good. (2) People practice justice unwillingly, from compulsion. (3) The unjust life is better.
- Ring of Gyges: with impunity (invisibility), both “just” and unjust would act unjustly, proving justice is kept only under constraint; seeming just while being unjust is most profitable.
- Extreme test: compare a perfectly unjust man who seems just (skilled, powerful, honored, prospers, even wins divine favor via lavish offerings) versus a perfectly just man who seems unjust (suffers torture, infamy, death). Judge which is happier.
- As Socrates moves to answer, Adeimantus interjects to strengthen the case against justice, adding another “praise/censure” dimension.
