- To read justice in the soul, Socrates argues city traits arise from individuals, then tests whether soul has distinct parts by the non-contradiction principle: the same thing cannot, in the same respect, at the same time, be/do opposites. He clarifies “same part/same relation” with the spinning top example.

- He classifies opposing states (assent/dissent, desire/aversion). Using relatives, he distinguishes simple from qualified desires: thirst as such is for drink as such; qualifications (cold, much, good) come from added conditions. This blocks the objection that all desire is simply “for the good.”

- Internal conflict (a thirsty man unwilling to drink) shows two principles: an appetitive part that bids toward satisfaction and a rational part that can forbid. Since one part cannot both attract and repel, these must be distinct.

- He isolates a third element, spirit (thumos). The Leontius story and self-reproach cases show anger often sides with reason against appetite; it refuses anger when one suffers deserved penalties but boils at perceived injustice, obeying reason like a shepherd’s dog.

- Conclusion: the soul has three parts—reason, spirit, appetite. Spirit is distinct from both and, when not corrupted by bad education, is reason’s natural ally (evidenced by spiritedness in children before reason matures), mirroring rulers, auxiliaries, producers in the city.
