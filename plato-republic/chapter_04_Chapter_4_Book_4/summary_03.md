- They accept “civic” courage (law-shaped true opinion steadfast against pleasures and pains) while excluding beastly/slavish boldness, and turn to temperance.
- Temperance is clarified via “self-mastery”: in a person, the better (rational) principle ruling the worse (appetites); in the city, the simple, reason-guided desires of the best-born/educated few restrain the manifold desires of the many. Unlike courage and wisdom, temperance pervades rulers and ruled as a harmony—an agreed recognition of who should rule—uniting stronger, weaker, and middle classes.
- Justice is then “found”: it is the founding principle repeatedly stated—each doing one’s own work and not meddling. This virtue undergirds and preserves wisdom, courage, and temperance, and is reflected in legal practice (neither taking another’s nor being deprived of one’s own). Class-crossing or role-mixing—trader forcing into warrior or ruler roles, or one person combining trader–warrior–ruler—ruins the city and is injustice; strict role-constancy across the three classes is justice.
- To confirm, they resolve to read justice in the individual: as the city is just when its three classes do their own, so the soul may be just if it has three parts—reason, spirit, appetite—each doing its own. Traits in cities derive from individuals (e.g., spirited Thracians, money-loving Phoenicians). The hard question now posed: does the soul truly have these three distinct principles?
