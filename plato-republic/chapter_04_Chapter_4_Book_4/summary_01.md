- Adeimantus objects that guardians live miserably compared to wealthy citizens; Socrates replies the aim is the city’s overall happiness, not any class’s. Guardians must be kept as true guardians; granting them luxuries would corrupt their function, as over-beautifying eyes ruins a statue. Let each class do its own work; when pretenders are cobblers it’s trivial, but when guardians only seem to guard, the city is overturned.
- Wealth and poverty alike ruin crafts: wealth breeds luxury and neglect; poverty breeds shabbiness and vice. Guardians must guard against both, since they generate discontent and deterioration.
- War: fewer, well-trained guardians can defeat larger rich armies, using skill, endurance, and stratagem. The city can ally with one rich city against another by offering spoils, since it keeps no gold/silver. Other “cities” are internally many—rich vs poor factions—so treat them as multiple groups to gain many friends and few enemies.
- Size limit: grow only so far as preserves unity; a small, self-sufficient, unified city with ~1,000 defenders can be strongest in deed.
- Maintain strict merit assignment: demote inferior guardian offspring; promote superior lower-class offspring, so each does the work nature fits, making the city “one.”
- Education/nurture is the single sufficient safeguard: good education yields good constitutions, which reinforce education and improve the “breed.” Guardians should hold things in common, extending to marriage and procreation arrangements.
- Preserve music and gymnastic unchanged; musical innovations endanger the laws (per Damon). Lawlessness seeps in via amusements, corrupting manners, contracts, then constitutions; thus early strict training in orderly play yields lifelong order and civic repair.
- Minor decorum rules (deference, dress, manners) can be left to habituation; detailed legislation on such matters is unwise and unstable.
