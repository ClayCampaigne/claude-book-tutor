- Early training: If youths’ amusements become lawless, they become lawless adults. Conversely, a strict musical upbringing implants a stable habit of order that carries into all actions and even repairs “fallen places” in the city.

- Minor norms: Well-educated citizens will themselves devise lesser rules (deference to elders, honoring parents, dress, hair, manners). Legislating such minutiae is unwise and unstable; the initial direction of education largely fixes life’s course.

- Positive vs. futile legislation: For good citizens, practical rules of markets, contracts, policing, dues, and procedures will be discovered as needed if the core laws hold. Without that, cities resemble intemperate invalids—ceaselessly “doctoring” themselves, hating truth-tellers, or like regimes that forbid constitutional change yet reward flattering politicians; such reformers merely “cut off Hydra’s heads.” True legislators ignore such enactments: useless in ill-ordered cities, and in well-ordered ones they flow naturally from earlier regulations.

- Religion deferred: Founders should entrust temples, sacrifices, hero-cults, funerary rites, and related observances to Delphi (Apollo).

- Hunting justice via the city’s four virtues: Identify wisdom, courage, temperance; the remainder will be justice.
  - Wisdom: the city is wise by the ruling guardians’ knowledge that counsels for the whole; this is the smallest class.
  - Courage: in the warrior part, as steadfast preservation of law-formed true opinion about what is and isn’t to be feared, held firm through pleasure, pain, fear, and desire (dyer’s “fast color” analogy). Beastly rashness is excluded.
  - Next: examine temperance before justice.
