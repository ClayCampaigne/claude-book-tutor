<CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>
Adeimantus objects that the guardians live worse than the rich, but Socrates insists the aim is the city’s happiness as a whole, not any class’s. Guardians must be kept truly guardians; to gild them with private wealth would corrupt their function—like over-beautifying a statue’s eyes. Justice requires each class to do its own work; when cobblers pretend, little harm follows, but when guardians only seem to guard, the city is overturned. Wealth and poverty alike ruin crafts—luxury breeds slackness, want breeds shabbiness and vice—so the guardians must ward off both. In war, a smaller, trained force using skill, endurance, and stratagem can beat larger rich armies; because the city hoards no gold or silver, it can ally rich cities against one another by offering spoils. Other “cities” are internally many—rich and poor factions—so treat them as multiple groups to gain many friends and few enemies.

The city must grow only so far as unity is preserved; a small, self-sufficient polis with about a thousand defenders can be strongest in deed. Strict merit rules apply: demote inferior guardian offspring and promote superior children of lower classes, so nature assigns each to the work it fits. Education is the sufficient safeguard: well-formed characters sustain good laws and breed better successors. Hence the guardians hold all in common, extending to regulated marriages and procreation. Music and gymnastic must remain unchanged; innovations in music endanger the laws. Lawlessness seeps in through amusements, so early training in orderly play yields lifelong order and civic repair. Minor decorum (deference, dress, manners) can be left to habituation; detailed legislation there is unstable. Practical rules of markets and policing follow naturally in a well-ordered city; in sick cities, constant “doctoring” is futile. Founders should entrust temples, sacrifices, hero-cults, and funerary rites to Delphi.

Hunting justice among the city’s virtues, they find wisdom in the rulers’ knowledge, courage in the warriors’ steadfast true opinions about fear, temperance as harmony agreeing who should rule, and justice as each doing one’s own. To confirm, they read the same in the soul: reason, spirit, and appetite must each do its work. Reason should rule, with spirit as its ally, restraining appetites. Thus the just person’s inner harmony mirrors the just city; justice is psychic health, vice disease. Hence injustice cannot profit. The best regime is the already described aristocracy; inferior regimes and souls will follow.
</CONDENSED CHAPTER SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>
- Adeimantus objects that guardians live miserably compared to wealthy citizens; Socrates replies the aim is the city’s overall happiness, not any class’s. Guardians must be kept as true guardians; granting them luxuries would corrupt their function, as over-beautifying eyes ruins a statue. Let each class do its own work; when pretenders are cobblers it’s trivial, but when guardians only seem to guard, the city is overturned.
- Wealth and poverty alike ruin crafts: wealth breeds luxury and neglect; poverty breeds shabbiness and vice. Guardians must guard against both, since they generate discontent and deterioration.
- War: fewer, well-trained guardians can defeat larger rich armies, using skill, endurance, and stratagem. The city can ally with one rich city against another by offering spoils, since it keeps no gold/silver. Other “cities” are internally many—rich vs poor factions—so treat them as multiple groups to gain many friends and few enemies.
- Size limit: grow only so far as preserves unity; a small, self-sufficient, unified city with ~1,000 defenders can be strongest in deed.
- Maintain strict merit assignment: demote inferior guardian offspring; promote superior lower-class offspring, so each does the work nature fits, making the city “one.”
- Education/nurture is the single sufficient safeguard: good education yields good constitutions, which reinforce education and improve the “breed.” Guardians should hold things in common, extending to marriage and procreation arrangements.
- Preserve music and gymnastic unchanged; musical innovations endanger the laws (per Damon). Lawlessness seeps in via amusements, corrupting manners, contracts, then constitutions; thus early strict training in orderly play yields lifelong order and civic repair.
- Minor decorum rules (deference, dress, manners) can be left to habituation; detailed legislation on such matters is unwise and unstable.
</CHUNK 1 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>
- Early training: If youths’ amusements become lawless, they become lawless adults. Conversely, a strict musical upbringing implants a stable habit of order that carries into all actions and even repairs “fallen places” in the city.

- Minor norms: Well-educated citizens will themselves devise lesser rules (deference to elders, honoring parents, dress, hair, manners). Legislating such minutiae is unwise and unstable; the initial direction of education largely fixes life’s course.

- Positive vs. futile legislation: For good citizens, practical rules of markets, contracts, policing, dues, and procedures will be discovered as needed if the core laws hold. Without that, cities resemble intemperate invalids—ceaselessly “doctoring” themselves, hating truth-tellers, or like regimes that forbid constitutional change yet reward flattering politicians; such reformers merely “cut off Hydra’s heads.” True legislators ignore such enactments: useless in ill-ordered cities, and in well-ordered ones they flow naturally from earlier regulations.

- Religion deferred: Founders should entrust temples, sacrifices, hero-cults, funerary rites, and related observances to Delphi (Apollo).

- Hunting justice via the city’s four virtues: Identify wisdom, courage, temperance; the remainder will be justice.
  - Wisdom: the city is wise by the ruling guardians’ knowledge that counsels for the whole; this is the smallest class.
  - Courage: in the warrior part, as steadfast preservation of law-formed true opinion about what is and isn’t to be feared, held firm through pleasure, pain, fear, and desire (dyer’s “fast color” analogy). Beastly rashness is excluded.
  - Next: examine temperance before justice.
</CHUNK 2 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>
- They accept “civic” courage (law-shaped true opinion steadfast against pleasures and pains) while excluding beastly/slavish boldness, and turn to temperance.
- Temperance is clarified via “self-mastery”: in a person, the better (rational) principle ruling the worse (appetites); in the city, the simple, reason-guided desires of the best-born/educated few restrain the manifold desires of the many. Unlike courage and wisdom, temperance pervades rulers and ruled as a harmony—an agreed recognition of who should rule—uniting stronger, weaker, and middle classes.
- Justice is then “found”: it is the founding principle repeatedly stated—each doing one’s own work and not meddling. This virtue undergirds and preserves wisdom, courage, and temperance, and is reflected in legal practice (neither taking another’s nor being deprived of one’s own). Class-crossing or role-mixing—trader forcing into warrior or ruler roles, or one person combining trader–warrior–ruler—ruins the city and is injustice; strict role-constancy across the three classes is justice.
- To confirm, they resolve to read justice in the individual: as the city is just when its three classes do their own, so the soul may be just if it has three parts—reason, spirit, appetite—each doing its own. Traits in cities derive from individuals (e.g., spirited Thracians, money-loving Phoenicians). The hard question now posed: does the soul truly have these three distinct principles?
</CHUNK 3 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>
- To read justice in the soul, Socrates argues city traits arise from individuals, then tests whether soul has distinct parts by the non-contradiction principle: the same thing cannot, in the same respect, at the same time, be/do opposites. He clarifies “same part/same relation” with the spinning top example.

- He classifies opposing states (assent/dissent, desire/aversion). Using relatives, he distinguishes simple from qualified desires: thirst as such is for drink as such; qualifications (cold, much, good) come from added conditions. This blocks the objection that all desire is simply “for the good.”

- Internal conflict (a thirsty man unwilling to drink) shows two principles: an appetitive part that bids toward satisfaction and a rational part that can forbid. Since one part cannot both attract and repel, these must be distinct.

- He isolates a third element, spirit (thumos). The Leontius story and self-reproach cases show anger often sides with reason against appetite; it refuses anger when one suffers deserved penalties but boils at perceived injustice, obeying reason like a shepherd’s dog.

- Conclusion: the soul has three parts—reason, spirit, appetite. Spirit is distinct from both and, when not corrupted by bad education, is reason’s natural ally (evidenced by spiritedness in children before reason matures), mirroring rulers, auxiliaries, producers in the city.
</CHUNK 4 SUMMARY>

<CHUNK 5 SUMMARY>
- Spirit (thumos) is confirmed as a distinct third principle of the soul, neither appetite nor reason: evidence from children’s early spiritedness before reason, spirited animals, and Homer’s self-rebuke line showing reason chastening anger.
- Thus the soul mirrors the city’s three classes: reason (rulers), spirit (auxiliaries), appetite (producers).
- Proper order: reason, knowing the good of each part and the whole, must rule; spirit, educated by music and gymnastic, allies with reason; together they guard and restrain the insatiable appetites.
- Virtues in the individual parallel the city:
  - Wisdom: the small ruling part’s knowledge of what benefits all parts.
  - Courage: spirit’s steadfast retention, through pleasures and pains, of reason’s directives about what to fear.
  - Temperance: concord—universal agreement that reason should rule.
  - Justice: each part doing its own work; inner noninterference and harmony.
- Practical upshot: the just person, so ordered, won’t commit theft, sacrilege, treachery, adultery, impiety, etc., because each part does its business.
- Justice/injustice as health/disease: just actions produce psychic order; unjust actions produce faction—usurpation of rule by a part—yielding vice (intemperance, cowardice, ignorance). Virtue = the soul’s health/beauty; vice = disease/deformity.
- Therefore the “profitability” of injustice is absurd: a corrupted soul makes life unendurable despite external goods.
- Transition: virtue is one; vices are many. There are five regime types and corresponding soul types; the best is the already-described aristocracy/monarchy (one or many rightly trained, same form).
