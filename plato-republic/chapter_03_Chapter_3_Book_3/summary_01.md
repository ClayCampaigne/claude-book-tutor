- Extending Book II’s theological censorship, Socrates targets poetry about death and Hades: to cultivate courage, youths must not be taught to dread the afterlife. Passages that make Hades terrifying, name gloomy rivers/ghosts, or depict souls as witless shades must be removed, since fear of death undermines warriors who should fear slavery more than death.
- Ban lamentation: guardians should be self-sufficient and least prone to grief; depictions of heroes or gods weeping, wailing, or groveling (Achilles, Priam, Olympians) are to be excluded. Such models breed whining and lack of self-control.
- Ban excessive laughter: portrayals of gods or worthy men overcome by laughter are disallowed; indulgence leads to destabilizing reactions.
- Truth and lies: lies are “medicines” useful only to rulers for public good (war or civic management). Private lying is subversive and must be punished.
- Temperance education: praise obedience and disciplined silence; condemn insolence toward rulers; suppress lines glorifying feasting/drunkenness or erotic escapades of gods; promote endurance sayings.
- Anti-corruption: forbid tales that normalize bribery/gifts or money-love (e.g., Achilles as mercenary or impious). Likewise reject stories of divine/heroic crimes (rapes, impieties). Poets must either deny the acts or deny divine parentage; evil cannot come from gods. Rationale: such myths license vice by example and corrupt the young.
