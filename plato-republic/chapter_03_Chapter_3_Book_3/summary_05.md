- Medicine as civic art: Asclepius is recast as a statesman-physician who treats sound constitutions with definite ailments quickly, enabling ordinary life, but refuses to prolong thoroughly diseased, intemperate lives—even if rich—since that harms both patient and city. Homeric examples (Menelaus, Eurypylus) support this; poets who say Asclepius took bribes are rejected as impious or incoherent.
- Judges vs physicians: The best physicians benefit from broad experience of diseases (even in themselves), since they heal bodies with the mind. But the best judges must not be trained by intimate experience of vice; rather, with a good soul and age, they learn evil by observing others. The criminally “cunning” misjudge virtue, mistaking their suspicion for wisdom; true wisdom belongs to the virtuous judge.
- Policy: Law and medicine should serve better natures—restore sound bodies and souls; let diseased bodies die and eliminate corrupt, incurable souls. Proper musical education makes citizens averse to litigation; simple gymnastic minimizes reliance on medicine.
- Aim of music and gymnastic: Both primarily shape the soul. Exclusive gymnastic breeds savagery; exclusive music breeds softness; each mis-educates spirit or gentleness. Balanced “harmonization” yields temperance and courage; a state needs a guardian-educator who tunes these like strings.
- Transition to rule selection: Elders rule, but the “best” must be those most devoted to the city’s good. Candidates are watched lifelong to see if they steadfastly retain their civic convictions and never abandon them under “force” or “enchantment.” Losing false beliefs is voluntary; losing truth is an involuntary deprivation to be analyzed (by theft, force, or enchantment).
