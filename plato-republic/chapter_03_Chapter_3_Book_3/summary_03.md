- Two speaking styles are contrasted: (1) mostly simple narration with minimal, noble imitation; (2) pantomimic, imitating anything and everything. Applying specialization (“one man, one craft”), the guardian’s city admits only the severe poet who imitates the virtuous; pantomimic performers, though admired, are ceremonially sent away.

- Having fixed the “matter and manner” of stories, they regulate melody and song: words must follow prior moral rules, and melody/rhythm must follow the words. Lamenting and “relaxed” modes (mixed/bass Lydian, Ionian/Lydian) are banned; retain only Dorian (warlike, steadfast) and Phrygian (moderate, persuasive/prayerful).

- Limit instruments to those suiting simplicity and civic use: exclude panharmonic complexity and flutes; keep lyre and harp in the city, pipe for shepherds (Apollo over Marsyas).

- Rhythms should express courageous, harmonious lives; avoid complex metres. Technical selection is deferred to Damon (Cretic, dactylic, iambic, trochaic), but the governing principle is that rhythm and harmony follow words, which reflect the soul’s temper; true simplicity of a well-ordered soul yields grace.

- Extend aesthetic control to all arts (sculpture, architecture, crafts): ban images of vice/indecency to prevent gradual moral corruption. A beautiful environment habituates youth to love the good before they can give reasons.

- As with learning letters and their reflections, guardians must learn to recognize the essential forms of virtues (temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence) and their opposites in all guises to be truly “musical.”
