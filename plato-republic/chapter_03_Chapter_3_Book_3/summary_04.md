- True love and education: The rightly “musical” soul loves beauty and order, preferring harmonious character over mere bodily beauty. Sensual pleasure—especially erotic indulgence—is allied to wantonness and madness, not temperance. Law for lovers: in the city, love must be chaste and paternal—no familiarity beyond what a father would show a son, only with consent and for a noble purpose; excess is shameful.

- Gymnastic follows music: the soul perfects the body more than the body perfects the soul. Guardians must avoid drunkenness and adopt a simple, military regimen that produces wakefulness and resilience amid varied conditions. Model: Homeric campaign fare—plain, roast meats; no luxury cuisine, courtesans, or confections. Simplicity in gymnastic breeds bodily health, just as simplicity in music breeds temperance; complexity yields disease.

- Medicine and law as symptoms of civic disease: The proliferation and prestige of courts and physicians signal bad education and intemperate living. Chronic litigiousness is disgraceful; a well-ordered life aims to do without judges.

- Critique of overmedicalization: Ancient Asclepiads treated definite ailments quickly, enabling ordinary life; Herodicus introduced “lingering death,” nurturing illness. Artisans rightly demand swift cures or death rather than life spent nursing disease. Excessive body-care especially among the rich obstructs virtue, governance, and study. Asclepius would not prolong thoroughly diseased lives or propagate weakness; cures should serve the citizen’s function and the state’s good.
