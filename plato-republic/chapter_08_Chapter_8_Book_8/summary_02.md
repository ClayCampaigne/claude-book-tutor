- Timocratic man recap and origin: He is honor- and power-loving, obedient to authority, harsh to slaves, courteous to free, a soldier who claims rule by feats, a good listener but poor speaker; youthful contempt for money gives way to avarice with age because he lacks philosophy “tempered with music,” the true guardian of virtue. His genesis: a brave but politically quietist father in a badly governed city; a status-seeking mother, complaisant servants, and public opinion shame the father’s non-litigious, non-money-loving ways. Pulled between his father’s rational nurture and others inflaming spirit and appetite, the son yields the “inner kingdom” to spirited contentiousness, becoming ambitious and timocratic.

- Transition to oligarchy (city): Private hoarding grows in timocracy; seeing others enrich themselves, citizens honor wealth over virtue. They enact property-qualifications for rule, often by force. Defects: rule by wealth is like choosing pilots by fortune—courts disaster; the city splits into two (rich vs. poor), is weak in war (fear arming the many; elites won’t pay), multiplies conflicting callings, and breeds extremes of wealth and pauperism. “Drones” arise: stingless paupers and stinging criminals; such vice stems from bad education and constitution.

- Oligarchic soul: A timocrat’s son sees his ambitious father ruined by the state and, fearing that fate, enthrones the money-loving appetite. Reason and spirit are made servants to wealth; he is penurious, satisfies only “necessary” desires, lacks cultivation, and suppresses rogue appetites by fear, not understanding—so they surface when he can spend others’ goods (e.g., orphan guardianship).
