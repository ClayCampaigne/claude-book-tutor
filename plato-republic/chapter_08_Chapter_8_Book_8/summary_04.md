- Democratic soul completed: External, pleasure-seeking companions ally with a youth’s suppressed “unnecessary” desires against paternal/oligarchic admonition, producing inner civil war. Lacking true education, new desires multiply, seize the “citadel” empty of genuine pursuits and “true words,” and install boastful opinions that block counsel. Virtues are expelled and vices rebranded: modesty as silliness, temperance as unmanliness, insolence as good breeding, anarchy as liberty, waste as magnificence, impudence as courage. The democratic man then spends on unnecessary as much as necessary pleasures; if somewhat sane with age, he readmits a few virtues but rotates authority among whichever desire is “up,” denies any hierarchy among pleasures, and lives episodically—drinking, dieting, training, idling, dabbling in philosophy, politics, war, or business—calling this lawless variety “freedom.” He mirrors the “spangled” democratic city and becomes widely imitated.

- From democracy to tyranny: Democracy’s chief good is freedom; its insatiable pursuit leads citizens to punish moderates as “oligarchs.” Equality invades all relations—father/son, teacher/student, young/old, master/slave, even animals; citizens grow hyper-allergic to any authority and disregard laws. Excess liberty flips into slavery; tyranny arises from extreme democracy.

- Shared pathology and class dynamics: “Drones” (idle spendthrifts—bold, stinging leaders; timid, stingless followers) plague cities. In democracies they dominate discourse, while:
  - The wealthy, orderly class is “squeezed” for honey.
  - The working “people” assemble only when given spoils.
  Demagogues confiscate from the rich, distribute a bit to the masses, keep most, and force the persecuted wealthy into genuine oligarchic resistance; impeachments and trials ensue—setting the stage for tyranny.
