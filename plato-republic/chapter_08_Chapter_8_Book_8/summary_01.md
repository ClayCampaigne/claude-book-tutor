- Setup and plan: Having completed the ideal “aristocracy” (philosopher-kings; common families/property for guardians), Socrates resumes the promised sequence of inferior regimes and matching souls: timocracy (honor-rule), oligarchy, democracy, tyranny. He will read the city first, then the soul, to compare happiness of just vs. unjust lives.

- Cause of decline from aristocracy to timocracy: All political change arises from divisions among rulers. The founders eventually mismanage reproduction by missing a mathematical “nuptial number” governing propitious unions; mistimed pairings yield inferior offspring. These successors undervalue music (rational, harmonizing education), then gymnastic, producing a less cultivated guardian class. They lose the art of testing “metals” (gold/silver/bronze/iron natures), mix classes, and generate inequality and faction. Conflict splits “iron/brass” (property-seeking) from “gold/silver” (virtue-seeking); a settlement privatizes land and houses and subjugates former free allies—producing a regime between aristocracy and oligarchy: timocracy.

- Features of the timocratic city: retains common meals, military training, and warrior abstention from crafts; distrusts philosophers and elevates spirited, warlike leaders; prizes stratagems and near-constant warfare; cultivates a secret love of wealth—hoarding privately and spending others’ resources—because open acquisition is barred; honors gymnastic over music. The spirited element dominates, fostering contention and ambition.

- Timocratic soul: ambitious, honor-loving, obedient, courteous to free but harsh to slaves; a good listener, poor speaker; claims rule via military merit; loves gymnastic and the hunt; initially scorns money but grows avaricious with age, lacking steadfast devotion to virtue (having lost his best rational-educational guardian).
