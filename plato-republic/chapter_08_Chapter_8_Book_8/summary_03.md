- Oligarchic man (miser): Because he lacks true cultivation, “drone-like” rogue appetites persist, merely suppressed by fear and necessity. In temptations involving others’ money (e.g., orphan guardianships), these desires surface, revealing “enforced virtue,” not rational self-mastery. He is internally divided; his better, necessary desires usually prevail, making him respectable but without true harmony. He shuns spending for honor, competing “with a small part of his resources,” and so typifies the oligarchic state.

- City’s slide to democracy: Oligarchies single-mindedly pursue wealth. Rulers refuse to curb youthful extravagance because they profit via interest and foreclosures, swelling their power. Wealth-love and moderation can’t coexist; many well-born become beggars, debtors, or disenfranchised, and simmer in hostile, revolutionary factions. Predatory lenders multiply “drones” (paupers and rogues). Remedies the rulers won’t adopt: limit use of private property; or at least make all voluntary contracts at one’s own risk to force character—both would reduce abuses. Elites and their youths grow idle and soft, indifferent to virtue; encounters in danger expose their weakness against hardy poor, emboldening the latter. Minor shocks trigger civil strife with outside allies; the poor prevail, killing/banishing some and instituting equal freedom and offices by lot.

- Democratic regime: maximal license, variety, and indulgent leniency; it ignores formative education and elevates anyone who flatters “the people,” dispensing equality to equals and unequals alike.

- Democratic soul’s genesis: The miser’s son, trained to repress “unnecessary” desires, meets pleasure-mongers and “tastes drones’ honey.” External indulgent desires ally with his own, provoking inner faction against familial rebuke. Distinction: necessary desires are inescapable and beneficial (e.g., simple sustenance); unnecessary are superfluous, trainable-away, and harmful, “spending” rather than “making.” The youth cycles between oligarchic restraint and resurgent kindred desires, which, lacking proper education, grow numerous and fierce—setting up the democratic character.
