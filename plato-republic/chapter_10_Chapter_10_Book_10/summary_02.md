- Reinforcing poets as mere imitators: Like painters, poets “lay on the colors” of crafts and virtues without knowledge; their verses seem wise only because meter and music seduce the ignorant. Stripped of musical ornament, their tales appear shallow.
- Threefold relation to things: For any artifact there are three arts—use, making, imitation. The user (e.g., horseman, flute-player) truly knows what is good; the maker attains only correct belief by heeding the user; the imitator has neither knowledge nor true opinion. Hence imitation targets appearances without grasping what makes things good or bad.
- Cognitive hierarchy: Sense appearances often conflict (size, refraction); measuring, numbering, and weighing “rescue” judgment—work of the rational/calculating part. Therefore imitation, which trades on appearance and illusion, allies with the inferior, nonrational principle of the soul, not with reason.
- Psychological harm of poetry: Poetic imitation depicts volatile emotions (grief, pity, laughter), which are easy to imitate and please crowds. In cases like bereavement, two principles contend within us: law/reason counsels restraint and practical deliberation; a lamenting impulse indulges sorrow. Popular poetry feeds and strengthens this irrational element, weakening reason’s rule.
- Even the good are harmed: By enjoying lamentations and buffoonery in theatre, we license dispositions we later need to restrain in our own lives, importing others’ evils into our souls. Thus the imitative poet implants a bad inner regime and should be excluded from the well-ordered city.
