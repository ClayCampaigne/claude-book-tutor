- Cosmic mechanism completed: atop each of the eight concentric whorls on Necessity’s spindle sits a Siren singing one tone; together they form a single harmony. The three Fates—Lachesis (past), Clotho (present), Atropos (future)—sit equidistant, singing with the Sirens; Clotho periodically helps turn the outer rim, Atropos guides inner circles, and Lachesis alternates, signaling Necessity’s governance of time and motion.

- Judgment and choice: A prophet, taking lots and “sample lives” from Lachesis, proclaims: souls will choose their own guardian spirit (genius) and life; virtue is free, responsibility lies with the chooser—God is justified. Lives on offer span human and animal, with mixes of wealth/poverty, health/disease, rank, talents, and even tyrannies of varying fates.

- Supreme human peril: the decisive task is to learn to discern good from evil and select the life that makes the soul just, disregarding all else. One must understand how combinations (beauty with wealth/poverty, noble or humble birth, public/private station, strength, cleverness, etc.) affect virtue, and choose the mean, avoiding extremes, in this and future lives.

- Choices and lessons: The first chooser, foolish and sensual, grabs tyranny and later sees it entails cannibalizing his children—blaming fate rather than himself. Souls from heaven, untested by suffering, choose rashly; those from earth choose more cautiously. A life grounded in philosophy plus moderate luck yields happiness and a smooth cycle. Examples: Orpheus picks a swan; Thamyras a nightingale; Ajax a lion; Agamemnon an eagle; Atalanta an athlete’s fame; Epeus a crafty woman; Thersites a monkey; Odysseus—last—wisely chooses an unnoticed private life.

- Sealing destinies: After choosing, each soul receives its chosen daimon from Lachesis, is ratified by Clotho and made irreversible by Atropos, passes under Necessity’s throne, then to the Plain of Forgetfulness and the River of Unmindfulness (Lethe). All must drink; the wise drink least and retain memory. A storm then propels souls to rebirth “like shooting stars.”

- Er, who did not drink, awakens on his pyre and reports the tale. Socrates’ exhortation: hold to the “heavenly way,” pursue justice and virtue, mindful of the soul’s immortality; obedience to this teaching preserves the soul from defilement and secures well-being in this life and through the thousand-year cycles.
