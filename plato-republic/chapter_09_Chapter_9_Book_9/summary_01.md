- Socrates pauses to clarify appetites: besides “necessary” desires, everyone harbors “unnecessary,” lawless ones that surface in dreams when reason sleeps. Proper regimen—moderate indulgence, calming spirit, and awakening reason before rest—yields truer, lawful visions, showing that education and discipline can subdue these impulses.

- From the democratic soul arises the tyrannical soul: the democrat’s son, reared in “moderate” license, is seduced by corrupters into “perfect liberty.” When they’re losing him, they implant a dominant, lawless passion—a “winged drone.” Love becomes the tyrant within, with Madness as captain, expelling shame and temperance.

- Lifestyle trajectory: revels and proliferating desires exhaust his means; debt follows; he preys on parents’ property, then deceives or assaults them. As conscience is overthrown, he commits sacrilege, theft, and violent crimes, becoming in waking life what others are only in unlawful dreams.

- If few, such men become mercenaries and criminal parasites; when numerous and abetted by popular infatuation, they elevate the most tyrannical among them as ruler. As private men and as rulers, they flatter or domineer—never befriend—are treacherous and utterly unjust, and grow more tyrannical with time.

- Regime and soul align: kingship/aristocracy best, tyranny worst; likewise the tyrannical man is the most miserable, despite appearances. True judgment must look past pomp to inner condition.
