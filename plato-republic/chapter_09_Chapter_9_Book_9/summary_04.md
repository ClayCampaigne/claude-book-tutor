- Finalizing the pleasure ranking: by successive “removals” from reason, the tyrant’s pleasure is a shadow thrice removed from the oligarch’s, and the oligarch is thrice removed from the royal/aristocratic. Squaring (plane) then cubing (solid) the triple yields 3^6 = 729: the king lives 729 times more pleasantly, the tyrant that much more painfully—a number tied to human cycles (days, nights, months, years).

- To answer the claim that injustice profits, Socrates images the soul as:
  - A many-headed beast (varied appetites),
  - A lion (spirit),
  - A man (reason), all sheathed in a human exterior.
  Justice means empowering the man to rule, allying the lion with him, and cultivating gentle heads while taming wild ones. Injustice feeds the monster and lion while starving the man, setting inner parts at war.

- Noble = the man/godlike element ruling beast; ignoble = man enslaved to beast. No wealth can compensate for enslaving the best part to the worst—worse than selling one’s children. Vices map to misrule: intemperance (monster rampant), pride/anger (lion swollen), luxury (lion enfeebled), flattery/meanness (lion made a monkey for money). “Mean” crafts are reproached insofar as they betray weakness of the ruling part.

- Law aims to install an inner guardian akin to a city’s constitution; external rule is a second-best when internal rule fails.

- Undetected injustice worsens the soul; punishment benefits by silencing the brutal part and freeing the gentle, perfecting the soul more than bodily gifts perfect the body.

- The wise person orders studies, body, wealth, and honors to preserve inner harmony (“the city within”), becoming a true statesman there; if possible, he would also rule the ideal city patterned on the “heavenly” model, but regardless he lives by that pattern.
