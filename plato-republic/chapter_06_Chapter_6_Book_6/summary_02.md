- Main claim: Philosophy’s bad reputation and the scarcity of true philosophers stem from systemic corruption of the best natures, not from philosophy itself.

- True philosophic nature recap: rare “plant” loving being and truth, hating falsehood, endowed with courage, temperance, memory, quickness, magnificence. Properly nurtured, it becomes supremely virtuous; miseducated, it becomes the worst.

- Causes of corruption:
  - Paradox of virtue and goods: the very excellences and external goods (beauty, wealth, strength, rank, connections) distract and deform the soul away from philosophy without proper education.
  - The many as the greatest Sophist: public assemblies, courts, theaters, etc. mold norms by loud praise/blame; youths cannot resist this flood, reinforced by sanctions (confiscation, death). Only divine intervention saves a few in diseased regimes.
  - Mercenary “Sophists” merely systematize crowd-pleasing—like a trainer of a powerful beast—calling good what the multitude likes, ignorant of the absolute Good/Just/Beautiful.

- Consequences:
  - The multitude will never accept Forms; thus they censure philosophers and those who seek to please the mob corrupt themselves.
  - Gifted youths are flattered and co-opted for others’ ends, become vain, resist true discipline; friends actively obstruct any turn toward philosophy.
  - Hence the greatest natures, misdirected, do the greatest evils (or goods if rightly turned). Philosophy is left “widowed”: her rightful suitors desert; unworthy imitators enter and disgrace her, fueling charges that philosophers are useless or vicious.
