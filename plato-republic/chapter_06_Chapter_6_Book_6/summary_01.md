- Question of rule: Since only philosophers grasp the eternal and unchanging realities (Forms), they alone can “see” the true natures of justice, beauty, and goodness and thus can found, order, and guard laws rightly. Rulers must have sight, not be “blind” to being.

- Profile of the true philosophical nature:
  - Loves all truth and all being; cannot abide falsehood.
  - Desires knowledge from youth; is absorbed in psychic pleasures, hence temperate and non-covetous.
  - Magnanimous, contemplating “all time and all existence”; neither fears death nor prizes petty human concerns; not mean or cowardly.
  - Just, gentle, sociable; not harsh in dealings.
  - Loves learning without pain; good memory; not forgetful.
  - Harmonious, well-proportioned mind akin to truth; naturally friendly to truth, justice, courage, temperance.
  - When perfected by age and education, only such people should be entrusted with the state.

- Adeimantus’ challenge: lifelong philosophers often become rogues or, at best, useless. Socrates agrees with the fact but explains via the “ship of state” parable: mutinous sailors (current politicians) scorn the true pilot (philosopher) as a stargazer; his “uselessness” stems from being unused by the ignorant, not from incompetence. Good rulers should not beg to rule; those needing rule should go to the capable. Socrates will next show why most “philosophers” are corrupted by circumstances, not by philosophy itself.
