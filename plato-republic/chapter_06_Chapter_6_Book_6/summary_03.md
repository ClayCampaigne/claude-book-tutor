- The best natures, if miseducated, are diverted from philosophy as much by wealth and honors as by corrupting influences; when such souls desert her, “puny” pretenders rush in, “marry” philosophy unworthily, and beget mere sophistries—ear-pleasing opinions devoid of true wisdom—thus disgracing philosophy’s name.

- A small remnant remain truly philosophical: a noble soul exiled from politics; a great spirit born in a base city who despises its life; a few who abandon arts they rightly disdain; Theages-like cases restrained from politics by illness; Socrates’ own divine sign. Seeing political life as bestial and unjust, they withdraw to preserve their own justice—unless they find a suitable city, in which case they could save both it and themselves.

- No existing regime suits philosophy; like exotic seed in foreign soil, philosophy there degenerates. But in a city matching philosophy’s perfection, her divinity would be manifest; such a city needs a living authority aligned with its founding vision.

- To prevent philosophy from ruining the state, reverse current practice: light, age-suited study in youth; priority to bodily training to serve later philosophy; in maturity intensify intellectual “gymnastics” (dialectic); in old age, free, serious philosophizing.

- The many disbelieve because they’ve seen only sham philosophy. Cities will not be happy until true philosophers are compelled to rule, or rulers are inspired to love true philosophy—possibilities, though difficult.

- Win the multitude gently by showing true philosophers’ real character. Hatred arises from pretenders who personalize disputes. True philosophers fix their gaze on unchanging being, imitate cosmic order, and thus are best artisans of justice, temperance, and all civic virtue; only states designed on this “heavenly pattern” can be happy.
