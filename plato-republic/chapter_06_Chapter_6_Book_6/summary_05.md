- Guardians must know the Good; without it they cannot truly know Beauty and Justice. Socrates refuses a full definition but offers an account of its “child”: the Sun.

- Sun analogy:
  - Sight and visible colors need a third thing—light; the sun is author of sight and visibility, though not identical with sight.
  - Beyond making things visible, the sun causes generation, nourishment, and growth in the visible realm.
  - Parallel in the intelligible: the Good gives truth to what is known and the power of knowing to the knower; it is the cause of the being/essence of intelligibles, yet itself “beyond essence” in dignity and power. Hence pleasure is not the Good.

- Divided Line (two realms, each split again), mapping objects to cognitive states by clarity:
  - Visible realm:
    1) Images (shadows, reflections) → imagination (perception of shadows).
    2) Physical things (animals, plants, artifacts) → belief/conviction.
  - Intelligible realm:
    3) Lower: mathematical/scientific thinking (geometry, arithmetic) reasons from unexamined hypotheses, using drawn figures as images of ideal objects; it does not ascend to a first principle → understanding (dianoia).
    4) Higher: dialectic uses hypotheses as stepping-stones to rise beyond them to the first principle (the Good), proceeding “from ideas, through ideas, in ideas,” then deducing downward without sensible aids → reason (noesis).

- Each faculty’s clarity matches the truth of its objects. This hierarchy grounds why philosopher-rulers must ascend to knowledge of the Good.
