- Glaucon acknowledges the ascent to the first principle via dialectic is a tremendous task but follows the distinction.
- Clarification of the Divided Line’s upper half: the “arts” like geometry proceed from unexamined hypotheses and thus employ understanding (dianoia), not the highest reason; their objects are intelligible but lack grounding in a first principle. When a first principle is added, these same objects become graspable by higher reason.
- Dialectic alone rises above hypotheses to the first principle (the Good), contemplates being and knowledge themselves, and then reasons back down “through ideas,” without sensible aids; its objects are clearer than those of the mathematical sciences.
- Cognitive powers mapped to the four segments:
  - Reason (noesis) → highest intelligibles grasped by dialectic.
  - Understanding (dianoia) → mathematical objects taken from hypotheses.
  - Faith/conviction (pistis) → beliefs about physical things.
  - Perception of shadows (eikasia) → imagination of images/reflections.
- Scale of clarity: each faculty’s certainty matches the truth/clarity of its objects. Glaucon assents to this arrangement.
