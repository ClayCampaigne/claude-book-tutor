- Founders may justly compel philosophers to rule: they were intentionally educated “as rulers of the hive,” owe a double duty, and, once habituated to “see in the dark,” will govern far better than cave-dwellers fixated on shadows. The best regime arranges a superior nonpolitical life for rulers so they accept office only as a necessary duty; eager office-seekers ruin cities through factional strife. True philosophers—rich in virtue and wisdom—are to be chosen as guardians precisely because they have better honors and a better life than politics.
- Education is the “turning around” of the soul from the shadowy day of becoming to the true day of being. The required knowledge must both elevate the soul and aid warfare.
- Gymnastic and music (as previously framed) don’t supply science; useful trades are “mean.” So begin with what all arts use: number and calculation. Arithmetic:
  - Draws the soul toward being by forcing reflection on “one” and plurality; sensory appearances yield contradictions (e.g., hard/soft, big/small), prompting intellect to distinguish the visible from the intelligible and to ask “What is absolute unity?”
  - Has double use: militarily (arraying forces, tactics) and philosophically (ascending from becoming to truth).
  - Must be studied abstractly (not for commerce), until rulers grasp numbers “with the mind only,” which best prepares the soul for higher studies and vision of being.
