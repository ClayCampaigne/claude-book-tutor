- Begin intellectual training in childhood as play, not compulsion: arithmetic, geometry, and related “preludes” should delight and reveal each child’s natural bent; forced learning doesn’t stick. Children should also be exposed to supervised “labours, lessons, dangers” (as with battlefield viewing) to identify those most at home in all.

- Gymnastic monopoly lasts 2–3 years, during which serious study is unprofitable. After this, at about age 20, selected youths study the sciences in an integrated way so they can see their interrelations and their relation to true being; the “comprehensive mind” marks dialectical talent.

- At 30, from this select group choose the most steadfast in studies and duties, and test them by dialectic—who can leave reliance on sense and grasp absolute being. Caution: premature dialectic breeds lawlessness. Analogy: like a rich youth who discovers his “parents” aren’t real and turns to flatterers, students whose inherited moral beliefs are refuted but who lack sight of truth become eristic and contemptuous of law. Hence introduce dialectic only to mature, orderly natures.

- Devote 5 years to dialectic (c. 30–35), then “return to the cave” for 15 years (to 50) of military and civic offices to test stability under temptations.

- At 50, those proven in action and knowledge behold the Good and rule as a duty, alternating governance with philosophy, training successors. After service they depart “to the Isles of the Blest”; public honors follow. Women share the same path.

- Feasibility: difficult but possible if true philosopher-kings arise and refound by removing citizens over ten and raising the children under the new laws. This best secures the ideal polity and its corresponding soul.
