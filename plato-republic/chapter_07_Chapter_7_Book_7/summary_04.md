- Harmonics, like astronomy, must be pursued as intelligible mathematics, not by empirical listening. Ear-based teachers “rack the strings” and Pythagoreans too err by measuring heard intervals without posing problems about why certain numbers are naturally harmonious. Studied for the beautiful and good, this inquiry is useful; otherwise useless.

- All preliminary studies gain civic value only when integrated—seen in their interrelations and mutual affinities. Until then, they are mere prelude.

- Dialectic is the “hymn” and coping-stone: an intellect-only method that, like turning from cave-shadows to the sun, raises the soul to grasp the absolute, especially the Good, by reasoning from and beyond hypotheses to first principles.

- Crafts deal with opinion/production; mathematics “dreams” of being because it leaves hypotheses unexamined. Only dialectic secures knowledge by examining first principles and using the prior sciences as handmaids. Reaffirms the four cognitive states: science and understanding (intellect, being) vs belief and image-perception (opinion, becoming).

- A true dialectician can define the essence of each thing and, above all, the Good, sustaining and refuting objections by truth, not opinion; otherwise one only apprehends shadows.

- Who should study dialectic: the same noble natures as before, plus keen, quick, tireless minds with strong memory and balanced industry (neither bodily-only nor learning-averse), lovers of truth who reject both voluntary and involuntary falsehood. Distinguish “true sons” from “bastards” in every virtue to avoid corrupt rulers.

- Begin the preparatory mathematical studies in youth (the time for extraordinary toil), though without coercive forcing; older beginners learn poorly.
