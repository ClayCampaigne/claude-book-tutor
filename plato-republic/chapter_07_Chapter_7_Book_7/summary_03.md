- Arithmetic: Guardians must study arithmetic not for trade but to behold numbers “with the mind only.” It compels pure intellection (units equal, indivisible, not divisible into perceptibles), sharply accelerates understanding even in the dull, and serves both war and philosophy by turning the soul from becoming to being. Hence it is necessary and difficult, suited to the best natures.

- Geometry: Beyond minimal military uses, its higher aim is knowledge of eternal being. Ordinary geometers err by focusing on practical operations (squaring/applying); true geometry raises the fallen “eye of the soul,” quickens learning generally, and must be strictly required.

- Curriculum order correction: After plane geometry should come solid geometry (stereometry) before astronomy. Solid geometry languishes due to lack of state patronage and directors and students’ conceit; if the whole city honored it, discovery would flourish. Proceed to astronomy only as fourth.

- Astronomy reoriented: Do not treat stargazing as philosophy. The visible heavens are beautiful but inexact; the true, invariant ratios and motions are grasped by reason via problems, not by sight.

- Harmonics as a sister science to astronomy: study intelligible harmonic motions (to the ear as stars are to the eye), avoiding current empirical, ear-based methods fixated on tiny intervals. Like astronomy, harmonics must be treated mathematically to elevate the soul.
