- Setting: Socrates and Glaucon visit the Piraeus for a new festival; Polemarchus and companions (including Adeimantus, Niceratus, Lysias, Euthydemus, Thrasymachus, Charmantides, Cleitophon) press them to stay for a nighttime torch-race on horseback and further conversation at Polemarchus’ house. Cephalus, Polemarchus’ aged father, is present.

- Cephalus on aging and wealth:
  - Complaints about old age stem more from character than from age; the calm-natured bear age lightly.
  - He cites Sophocles approvingly: old age frees one from tyrannical passions.
  - Wealth is not the main reason he bears age well, though it helps; character matters more than riches or poverty.
  - He is a moderate self-made heir (between a wealth-increasing grandfather and a diminishing father).
  - Greatest benefit of wealth for a good man: peace of mind near death—no need to deceive or defraud; no fear about unpaid debts to gods or men, fostering hopeful conscience.

- Turn to justice:
  - Socrates tests “justice = truth-telling and paying debts” with the madman/arms deposit case, showing exceptions.
  - Cephalus departs; Polemarchus inherits the argument, invoking Simonides: justice is giving each what is due—doing good to friends and harm to enemies.
  - Via craft analogies (medicine, piloting, cookery), Socrates elicits that this view makes justice the “art” of benefiting friends and harming enemies, especially in war and alliances, hinting at context-dependent usefulness.
