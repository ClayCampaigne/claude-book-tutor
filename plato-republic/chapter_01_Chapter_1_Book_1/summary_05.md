- Method: Socrates rejects competing set speeches with “judges” and insists on dialectical Q&A via mutual admissions.

- Thrasymachus’ stance sharpened: perfect injustice is more profitable; he rebrands justice as “sublime simplicity” and injustice as “discretion,” calling the perfectly unjust (e.g., conquerors of states) wise and good.

- Socratic “overreaching” argument:
  - Just person: does not seek to have more than his like (another just person) but would seek advantage over the unjust.
  - Unjust person: seeks to have more than both like and unlike.
  - Craft analogies (musician, physician): the knowledgeable do not try to exceed equals, only the ignorant; the ignorant try to exceed both.
  - Therefore, the just aligns with the wise and good; the unjust with the ignorant and bad. Thrasymachus reluctantly concedes.

- Strength/practicality:
  - If justice = wisdom and injustice = ignorance, justice is stronger.
  - Collective action test: cities/armies/gangs cannot function if they wrong one another; injustice breeds faction, hatred, and incapacity; only residual justice enables cooperation. Perfect injustice would self-destruct.
  - Parallel in the individual: injustice divides the self, producing inner conflict; gods are just, so the unjust are enemies of gods, the just are friends.

- Next step toward “best life”: Socrates sets up the ergon/arete framework—everything has a function/end it alone performs best (eye/seeing, ear/hearing, pruning-hook/pruning), and each has a corresponding excellence—preparing to apply this to the soul and justice.
