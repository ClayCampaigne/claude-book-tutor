- Regulating procreation as “medicine”: Rulers must secretly manage marriages and births for the city’s good, using “lawful” falsehood—e.g., rigged lots at sacred festivals—to pair the best with the best frequently, the inferior seldom, and to hide manipulation to prevent resentment. Population is kept stable by adjusting marriage numbers to war, disease, etc.
- Procreative honors and culling: Braver/better youths get more access to women to sire many children. Offspring of good pairings are taken to communal nurseries; those of inferior unions or deformed infants are removed to an unknown place (to keep the guardian “breed” pure).
- Communal rearing: Mothers nurse in rotation without knowing their own children; wet nurses supplement; suckling is brief; mothers are spared night duties.
- Age bounds and sanctions: Women 20–40, men 25–55 may beget for the State. Unions outside ages or unsanctioned within ages are impious; resulting embryos are not to be brought up.
- Kinship rules: Actual parentage is unknown; social kinship is assigned by timing from the hymeneal (7th–10th month children counted as yours). Sibling intermarriage is barred except by favorable lot and Pythian approval.
- Aim: maximal civic unity. Community of women/children and property eradicates “mine/not mine” disputes, aligns pleasures and pains, and makes guardians truly “fellow-guardians.” Citizens call rulers saviors/helpers; rulers call citizens maintainers/foster-fathers; guardians treat one another as kin in deed (filial duties enforced).
- Social effects: No suits over money/children/relations; minimal assaults/insults; elders rule and correct younger; shame and fear deter youth from harming elders, backed by communal solidarity.
