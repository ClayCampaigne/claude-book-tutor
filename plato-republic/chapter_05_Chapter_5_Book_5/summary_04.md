- With communal property and families, guardian quarrels over money, children, or kin vanish; no suits for assault/insult arise. Elders rule and chastise juniors; shame (filial reverence) and fear (collective backing) deter youth from harming elders, sustaining internal peace and unity.
- Guardians avoid petty social ills (flattery of rich, domestic money anxieties). Their life is happier than Olympic victors: maintained publicly, honored in life and burial, since their “victory” is the city’s salvation. Any guardian seeking private happiness that dissolves guardianship is warned to accept “half is more than the whole.”
- Men and women guardians share the same life: common education, children, and military duties, “hunting together like dogs,” preserving natural sex relations while maximizing civic good.
- Military training: children witness safe campaigns under veteran leaders, riding tractable swift horses to observe and, if needed, escape—both educating youths and spurring parents’ valor while managing risk.
- Discipline and honors in war: cowards (deserters, arms-throwers) are demoted to artisan/farmer; captives are forfeited to enemies. The brave receive public crowns, handshakes, kisses (even preferential license in camp), priority in marriages and procreation, choice portions at sacrifices, seats of precedence; fallen heroes are hailed “golden race,” revered as Hesiodic daimones; similar honors for the supremely good who die otherwise.
- Conduct toward Hellenes: do not enslave Greeks; abstain from stripping corpses, hindering burial, or dedicating Greek spoils; forbid devastation and house-burning—take only the year’s produce. Justification: distinguish internal “discord” (among kin Hellenes) from external “war” (against barbarians); the Hellenes’ kinship warrants restraint and unity.
