- Clarifying “different natures”: Only differences relevant to a craft justify different pursuits. Sex differences limited to begetting/bearing don’t warrant different education or roles. Where men and women share the relevant capacities (medicine, music, war, philosophy, spirit), they should share training and offices.
- Degree vs kind: While, on average, males exceed females in many abilities, there is no uniquely male or female civic-administrative faculty. Individuals vary: some women are suited to guardianship, others not—selection should use the same tests as for men.
- Policy affirmed: Women guardians receive the same musical, gymnastic, and military education; they perform the same duties, with lighter tasks allotted to women due to relative weakness. Naked training is defended: what is useful is noble. This law is both possible and highly beneficial; it makes the city better by making both men and women as good as possible.
- Next “greater wave”: Wives and children of guardians are to be in common; no one knows their own kin. Socrates asks to assume possibility and argue utility/implementation first.
- Implementation sketch: Guardians and their selected wives live communally (common houses/meals, no private property), are educated and exercise together, and must obey laws and their spirit. Marriages are sacred and regulated for maximal civic benefit via controlled pairings: best with best (at ripe age), inferior with inferior rarely; rear only the better offspring. Rulers deploy “medicinal” falsehoods to manage pairings and births secretly to prevent unrest. Festivals with sacrifices/hymeneal songs conceal allocations. Rulers adjust the number of unions to maintain a stable population, considering war, disease, and similar factors.
