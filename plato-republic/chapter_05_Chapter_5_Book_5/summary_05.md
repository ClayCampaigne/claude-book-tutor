- Final Hellenic war laws: Guardians must not dedicate Greek spoils in temples, devastate Greek lands, or burn houses. Internal Greek conflicts are “discord” among kin, not true “war”; they should aim at reconciliation, punish only the guilty few, and spare the many. This law is enacted.

- Shift to feasibility (“third wave”): Adeimantus grants the proposed city’s many benefits (greater bravery from mutual kinship; even invincibility if women serve with men) but demands proof of possibility. Socrates clarifies the ideal serves as a model; approximate realization suffices. Words outrun facts, so exact coincidence isn’t required. Seek the fewest, smallest changes to convert cities—ideally one.

- Greatest claim: Cities (and humankind) will know rest only when philosophers rule or rulers truly philosophize; otherwise no happiness public or private. Though provocative, Socrates proceeds under challenge to define who counts as a philosopher fit to rule.

- Opening definition by eros: As true lovers desire the whole of what they love (beauty, wine, honor), the philosopher loves all wisdom—insatiably learning; those averse to learning (especially in youth) aren’t philosophers.

- Glaucon’s objection: This criterion wrongly sweeps in “lovers of sights and sounds” and musical enthusiasts who chase performances but avoid rational discussion—prompting a stricter distinction next.
